## Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

## Basis of Presentation and Preparation

The  condensed  consolidated  financial  statements  include  the  accounts  of  Apple  Inc.  and  its  wholly  owned  subsidiaries (collectively  'Apple'  or  the  'Company').  In  the  opinion  of  the  Company's  management,  the  condensed  consolidated  financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ('GAAP') requires the use of management estimates. These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company's annual consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2024 (the '2024 Form 10-K').

The Company's fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company's fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. The Company's fiscal years 2025 and 2024 span 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company's fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.

(1) The valuation techniques used to measure the fair values of the Company's Level 2 financial instruments, which generally have counterparties with high credit ratings, are based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.

(2) As of September 28, 2024, cash and cash equivalents included $2.6 billion held in escrow and restricted from general use. These  restricted  cash  and  cash  equivalents  were  designated  to  settle  the  Company's  obligation  related  to  the  2016 European Commission (the 'Commission') decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company (the 'State Aid Decision'), which was confirmed during the fourth quarter of 2024 by the European Court of Justice in a reversal of the 2020 judgment of the European General Court.

(3) As of September 28, 2024, current marketable securities included $13.2 billion held in escrow and restricted from general use.  These  restricted  marketable  securities  were  designated  to  settle  the  Company's  obligation  related  to  the  State  Aid Decision.

As of March 29, 2025, 83% of the Company's non-current marketable debt securities other than mortgage- and asset-backed securities had maturities between 1 and 5 years, 13% between 5 and 10 years, and 4% greater than 10 years. As of March 29, 2025, 13% of the Company's non-current mortgage- and asset-backed securities had maturities between 1 and 5 years, 10% between 5 and 10 years, and 77% greater than 10 years.

## Derivative Instruments and Hedging

The Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates.

## Foreign Exchange Rate Risk

To  protect  gross  margins  from  fluctuations  in  foreign  exchange  rates,  the  Company  may  use  forwards,  options  or  other instruments,  and  may  designate  these  instruments  as  cash  flow  hedges.  The  Company  generally  hedges  portions  of  its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.

To  protect  the  Company's  foreign  currency-denominated  term  debt  or  marketable  securities  from  fluctuations  in  foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of March 29, 2025, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt-related foreign currency transactions is 17 years.

The Company may also use derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.

## Interest Rate Risk

To protect the Company's term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may use interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges.

The notional amounts of the Company's outstanding derivative instruments as of March 29, 2025 and September 28, 2024 were as follows (in millions):

|                                                             | March 29, 2025   | September 28, 2024   |

| Interest rate contracts                                     | $ 14,575         | $ 14,575             |
| Derivative instruments not designated as accounting hedges: |                  |                      |

As of March 29, 2025 and September 28, 2024, the carrying amount of the Company's current and non-current term debt subject to fair value hedges was $13.4 billion and $13.5 billion, respectively.

## Accounts Receivable

## Trade Receivables

The Company's third-party cellular network carriers accounted for 37% and 38% of total trade receivables as of March 29, 2025 and September 28, 2024, respectively. The Company requires third-party credit support or collateral from certain customers to limit credit risk.

## Vendor Non-Trade Receivables

The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. The Company does not reflect the sale of these components in products net sales. Rather, the Company recognizes any gain on these sales as a reduction of products cost of sales when the related final products are sold by the Company. As of March 29, 2025, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 49% and 19%. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 44% and 23%.

## Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

This Item and other sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q ('Form 10-Q') contain forward-looking statements, within the  meaning  of  the  Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform  Act  of  1995,  that  involve  risks  and  uncertainties.  Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future impact  of  macroeconomic  conditions  and  tariffs  and  other  trade  measures  on  the  Company's  business  and  results  of operations  are  forward-looking  statements .

Forward-looking  statements  are  not  guarantees  of  future  performance  and  the  Company's  actual  results  may differ  significantly  from  the  results  discussed  in  the  forward-looking  statements.  Factors  that  might  cause  such  differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the 2024 Form 10-K and Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q, in each case under the heading 'Risk Factors.' The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.

Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  information  presented  herein  is  based  on  the  Company's  fiscal  calendar,  and  references  to particular  years,  quarters,  months  or  periods  refer  to  the  Company's  fiscal  years  ended  in  September  and  the  associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2024 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the 'SEC') and the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.

## Available Information

The Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and its investor relations  website,  investor.apple.com.  This  includes  press  releases  and  other  information  about  financial  performance, information on corporate governance, and details related to the Company's annual meeting of shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not incorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Company's references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only.

## Business Seasonality and Product Introductions

The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales  and  operating  expenses.  The  timing  of  product  introductions  can  also  impact  the  Company's  net  sales  to  its  indirect distribution  channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction.

During the second quarter of 2025, the Company announced the following new or updated products:

- iPhone 16e
- iPad Air ®
- iPad
- MacBook Air ®
- Mac Studio ®

## Macroeconomic Conditions

Macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, interest rates and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company's results of operations and financial condition.

## Tariffs and Other Trade Measures

Beginning in the second quarter of 2025, new tariffs were announced on imports to the U.S. ('U.S. Tariffs'), including additional tariffs  on  imports from China, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and the European Union ('EU'), among others. In response,  several  countries  have  imposed,  or  threatened  to  impose,  reciprocal  tariffs  on  imports  from  the  U.S.  and  other retaliatory  measures.  Various  modifications  and  delays  to  the  U.S.  Tariffs  have  been  announced  and  further  changes  are expected to be made in the future, which may include additional sector-based tariffs or other measures. For example, the U.S. Department of Commerce has initiated an investigation under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, into,  among  other  things,  imports  of  semiconductors,  semiconductor  manufacturing  equipment,  and  their  derivative  products, including  downstream  products  that  contain  semiconductors.  Tariffs  and  other  measures  that  are  applied  to  the  Company's products or their components can have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition,  including  impacting  the  Company's  supply  chain,  the  availability  of  rare  earths  and  other  raw  materials  and components,  pricing  and  gross  margin.  The  ultimate  impact  remains  uncertain  and  will  depend  on  several  factors,  including whether  additional  or  incremental  U.S.  Tariffs  or  other  measures  are  announced  or  imposed,  to  what  extent  other  countries implement tariffs or other retaliatory measures in response, and the overall magnitude and duration of these measures. Trade and other international disputes can have an adverse impact on the overall macroeconomic environment and result in shifts and reductions in consumer spending and negative consumer sentiment for the Company's products and services, all of which can further adversely affect the Company's business and results of operations.

## Provision for Income Taxes

Provision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for the three- and six-month periods ended March 29, 2025 and March 30, 2024 were as follows (dollars in millions):

The  Company's  effective  tax  rate  for  the  second  quarter  of  2025  was  lower  than  the  statutory  federal  income  tax  rate  due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, including the impact of changes in unrecognized tax benefits, partially offset  by  state  income  taxes.  The  Company's  effective  tax  rate  for  the  first  six  months  of 2025  was  lower  than  the  statutory federal  income  tax  rate  due  primarily  to  a  lower  effective  tax  rate  on  foreign  earnings,  including  the  impact  of  changes  in unrecognized tax benefits, tax benefits from share-based compensation, the impact of foreign currency loss regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in December 2024, and the tax impact from foreign currency revaluations related to the State Aid Decision.

The  Company's  effective  tax  rate  for  the  second  quarter  of  2025  was  lower  compared  to  the  second  quarter  of  2024  due primarily to the impact of changes in unrecognized tax benefits, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate on foreign earnings. The Company's effective tax rate for the first six months of 2025 was lower compared to the same period in 2024 due primarily to the  impact  of  changes  in  unrecognized  tax  benefits,  the  impact  of  foreign  currency  loss  regulations  issued  by  the  U.S. Department of the Treasury in December 2024, and the tax impact from foreign currency revaluations related to the State Aid Decision, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate on foreign earnings.

## Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond.

The Company's contractual cash requirements have not changed materially since the 2024 Form 10-K, except for manufacturing purchase obligations and the State Aid Decision tax payable.

## Manufacturing Purchase Obligations

The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company's products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety  of  individual  suppliers.  As  of  March  29,  2025,  the  Company  had  manufacturing  purchase  obligations  of  $38.4  billion, which were payable within 12 months.

## State Aid Decision Tax Payable

During the first six months of 2025, the Company released from escrow €14.2 billion or $15.4 billion to Ireland in connection with the State Aid Decision, which fully settled the obligation.

## Capital Return Program

In addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program, under which the remaining availability was $40.8 billion as of March 29, 2025. On May 1, 2025, the Company announced the Board of Directors had authorized an additional program to repurchase up to $100 billion of the Company's common stock. The programs do not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares.

On May 1, 2025, the Company also announced the Board of Directors raised the Company's quarterly cash dividend from $0.25 to $0.26 per share, beginning with the dividend to be paid during the third quarter of 2025. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.

During the second quarter of 2025, the Company repurchased $25.0 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $3.8 billion.

In November 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the 'FASB') issued Accounting Standards Update ('ASU') No. 2024-03, Income  Statement-Reporting  Comprehensive  Income-Expense  Disaggregation  Disclosures  (Subtopic  220-40): Disaggregation  of  Income  Statement  Expenses ('ASU 2024-03') and in  January  2025,  the  FASB  issued  ASU  No.  2025-01, Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income-Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Clarifying the Effective Date , which clarified the effective date of ASU 2024-03. ASU 2024-03 will require the Company to disclose the amounts of  purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation and intangible asset amortization, as applicable, included in certain  expense  captions  in  the  Consolidated  Statements  of  Operations,  as  well  as  qualitatively  describe  remaining  amounts included  in  those  captions.  ASU  2024-03  will  also  require  the  Company  to  disclose  both  the  amount  and  the  Company's definition of selling expenses. The Company will adopt ASU 2024-03 in its fourth quarter of 2028 using a prospective transition method.

## Income Taxes

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures ('ASU 2023-09'), which will require the Company to disclose specified additional information in its income tax rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. ASU 2023-09 will also require the Company  to  disaggregate  its  income  taxes  paid  disclosure  by  federal,  state  and  foreign  taxes,  with  further  disaggregation required  for  significant  individual  jurisdictions.  The  Company  will  adopt  ASU  2023-09  in  its  fourth  quarter  of  2026  using  a prospective transition method.

## Segment Reporting

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures ('ASU 2023-07'), which will require the Company to disclose segment expenses that are significant and regularly provided to  the  Company's chief  operating  decision  maker  ('CODM').  In  addition,  ASU  2023-07  will  require  the  Company  to disclose the title and position of its CODM and how the CODM uses segment profit or loss information in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. The Company will adopt ASU 2023-07 in its fourth quarter of 2025 using a retrospective transition method.

## Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP and the Company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company's management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, 'Summary of Significant Accounting Policies' of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2024 Form 10-K describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company's  condensed  consolidated  financial  statements.  There  have  been  no  material  changes  to  the  Company's  critical accounting estimates since the 2024 Form 10-K.

## Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

There have been no material changes to the Company's market risk during the first six months of 2025. For a discussion of the Company's exposure to market risk, refer to the Company's market risk disclosures set forth in Part II, Item 7A, 'Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk' of the 2024 Form 10-K.

## Item 4. Controls and Procedures

## Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, the Company's principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of March 29, 2025 to provide reasonable assurance that  information  required  to  be  disclosed  by  the  Company  in  reports  that  it  files  or  submits  under  the  Exchange  Act  is (i)  recorded,  processed,  summarized  and  reported  within  the  time  periods  specified  in  the  SEC  rules  and  forms  and (ii)  accumulated  and  communicated  to  the  Company's  management,  including  its  principal  executive  officer  and  principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

## Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the second quarter of 2025, which were identified  in  connection  with  management's  evaluation  required  by  paragraph  (d)  of  Rules  13a-15  and  15d-15  under  the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

## PART II  -  OTHER INFORMATION

## Item 1. Legal Proceedings

## Digital Markets Act Investigations

On  March  25,  2024,  the  Commission  announced  that  it  had  opened  two  formal  noncompliance  investigations  against  the Company under the EU Digital Markets Act (the 'DMA'). The Commission's investigations concerned (1) Article 5(4) of the DMA, which relates to how developers may communicate and promote offers to end users for apps distributed through the App Store as well as how developers may conclude contracts with those end users (the 'Article 5(4) Investigation'); and (2) Article 6(3) of the DMA, which relates to default settings, uninstallation of apps, and a web browser choice screen on iOS (the 'Article 6(3) Investigation').  On  June  24,  2024,  the  Commission  announced  that  it  had  opened  a  third  formal  investigation  against  the Company regarding whether the Company's new contractual requirements for third-party app developers and app marketplaces may violate the DMA (the 'Article 6(4) Investigation'). On April 23, 2025, the Commission fined the Company €500 million in the Article  5(4)  Investigation  and  issued  a  cease  and  desist  order  requiring  the  Company  to  remove  technical  and  commercial restrictions that prevent developers from steering users to alternative distribution channels outside the App Store. The Company plans to appeal the Commission's Article 5(4) decision. Unless a stay is granted, any order by the Commission is effective while an appeal is pending. Also on April 23, 2025, the Commission closed the Article 6(3) Investigation without imposing a fine and issued preliminary findings  in  the  Article  6(4)  Investigation.  If  the  Commission  makes  a  final  determination  in  the  Article  6(4) Investigation  that  there  has  been  a  violation,  it  can  issue  a  cease  and  desist  order  and  may  impose  fines  up  to  10%  of  the Company's annual worldwide net sales. The Commission may also seek to impose additional fines if it deems that the Company has violated a cease and desist order. The Company believes that it complies with the DMA and has continued to make changes to its compliance plan in response to feedback and engagement with the Commission.

## Department of Justice Lawsuit

On March 21, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice (the 'DOJ') and a number of state and district attorneys general filed a civil antitrust  lawsuit  in  the  U.S.  District  Court  for  the  District  of  New  Jersey  against  the  Company  alleging  monopolization  or attempted monopolization in the markets for 'performance smartphones' and 'smartphones' in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. The DOJ is seeking equitable relief to redress the alleged anticompetitive behavior. In addition, various civil litigation matters have been filed in state and federal courts in the U.S. alleging similar violations of U.S. antitrust laws and seeking monetary damages and other nonmonetary relief. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself.

## Epic Games

Epic Games, Inc. ('Epic') filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the 'California District Court') against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California's unfair competition law based upon the Company's operation of its App Store. The California District Court found that certain provisions of the Company's App Review  Guidelines  violate  California's  unfair  competition  law  and  issued  an  injunction  (the  '2021  Injunction')  enjoining  the Company from  prohibiting  developers  from  including  in  their  apps  buttons,  external  links,  or  other  calls  to  action  that  direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than the Company's in-app purchase system. The 2021 Injunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefronts of the iOS and iPadOS ®  App Stores. On January 16, 2024, the Company implemented a plan to comply with  the  2021  Injunction  and  filed  a  statement  of  compliance  with  the  California  District  Court.  On  September  30,  2024,  the Company  filed  a  motion  with  the  California  District  Court  to  narrow  or  vacate  the  2021  Injunction.  On  April  30,  2025,  the California District Court found the Company to be in violation of the 2021 Injunction and enjoined the Company from imposing any commission or any fee on purchases that consumers make outside an app; restricting, conditioning, limiting, or prohibiting how developers guide consumers to purchases outside an app; or otherwise interfering with a consumer's choice to proceed in or out of an app. The California District Court also denied the Company's motion to narrow or vacate the 2021 Injunction and referred the Company to the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California for a determination whether criminal contempt proceedings are appropriate. The Company will continue to vigorously defend its actions and employees, including by appealing the California District Court's most recent decision.

## Other Legal Proceedings

The Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the second quarter of 2025 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company's financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management's expectations, the Company's financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.

## Item 1A. Risk Factors

The Company's business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described in Part I, Item 1A of the 2024 Form 10-K and Part II, Item 1A of the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 28, 2024 (the 'first quarter 2025 Form 10-Q'), in each case under the heading 'Risk Factors.' When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company's business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected. Except for the risk factors set forth  below  and  those  disclosed  in  Part  II,  Item  1A  of  the  first  quarter  2025  Form  10-Q,  which  are  hereby  incorporated  by reference into this Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q, there have been no material changes to the Company's risk factors since the 2024 Form 10-K.

## The  Company's  business  can  be  impacted  by  political  events,  trade  and  other  international  disputes,  geopolitical tensions, conflict, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.

Political events, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical tensions, conflict, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues,  industrial  accidents  and  other  business  interruptions  can  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  the  Company  and  its customers,  employees,  suppliers,  contract  manufacturers,  logistics  providers,  distributors,  cellular  network  carriers  and  other channel partners.

The Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company's total net sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. A significant majority of the Company's manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, in addition to sourcing from partners and facilities located in the U.S. Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, can materially adversely affect the Company's business and supply chain. The impact can be particularly significant if these restrictive measures apply to countries and regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its  revenues  and/or  has  significant  supply  chain  operations. Restrictive  measures  can  increase  the  cost  of  the  Company's  products  and  the  components  and  rare  earths  and  other  raw materials that go into them or affect the availability of such components and rare earths and other raw materials, and can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships and operations, ceasing to offer and distribute affected products, services and third-party applications to its customers, and increasing the prices of its products and services. Changing the Company's business and supply chain in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company's business and results of operations. Trade and other international disputes can also have an adverse impact on the overall macroeconomic environment and result in shifts and reductions in consumer spending and negative consumer sentiment for the Company's products and services, all of which can further adversely affect the Company's business and results of operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice, which can create uncertainty, and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate any or all adverse impacts from such measures. Beginning in the second quarter of 2025, new U.S. Tariffs were announced, including additional tariffs  on  imports  from  China,  India,  Japan,  South  Korea,  Taiwan,  Vietnam  and  the  EU,  among  others.  In  response,  several countries  have  imposed,  or  threatened  to  impose,  reciprocal  tariffs  on  imports  from  the  U.S.  and  other  retaliatory  measures. Various modifications and delays to the U.S. Tariffs have been announced and further changes are expected to be made in the future, which may include additional sector-based tariffs or other measures. For example, the U.S. Department of Commerce has initiated an investigation under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, into, among other things, imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and their derivative products, including downstream products that contain semiconductors. The ultimate impact remains uncertain and will depend on several factors, including whether additional or  incremental U.S. Tariffs or other measures are announced or imposed, to what extent other countries implement tariffs or other  retaliatory  measures  in  response,  and  the  overall  magnitude  and  duration  of  these  measures. If  disputes  and  conflicts further escalate, actions by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive. Any of the foregoing could materially adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.

Many of the Company's operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company's suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. Global climate change is resulting in certain types of natural disasters and extreme weather occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. In addition, the Company's and its suppliers' operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption  by  fire,  power  shortages,  nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond the Company's control. For example, global supply chains can be highly concentrated and geopolitical tensions or conflict could result in significant disruptions.

Such events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company's supply and manufacturing chain, result in slowdowns and outages to the Company's service offerings, increase the Company's costs, and negatively impact consumer spending and demand in affected areas.

The Company's operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company's suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company's business, and harm to the Company's reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the future materially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the  imposition  of  protective  public  safety  measures,  such  as  stringent  employee  travel  restrictions  and  limitations  on  freight services and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company's operations, supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to the supply of current products and offering of existing services, and delays in production ramps of new products and development of new services.

Following  any  interruption  to  its  business,  the  Company  can  require  substantial  recovery  time,  experience  significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply  and  manufacture  of  many  critical  components,  a  business  interruption  affecting  such  sources  would  exacerbate  any negative consequences to the Company. While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise.

## The Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate.

The Company's profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, the gross margins on the Company's products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company's gross margins are subject to volatility  and  downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product  pricing  pressures  and  product  pricing  actions  that  the  Company  may  take  in  response  to  such  pressures;  increased competition; the Company's ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product life  cycles;  supply  shortages;  potential  increases  in  the  cost  of  components,  outside  manufacturing  services,  and  developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company's services; the Company's ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory  changes  require  the  Company  to  modify  its  product  and  service  offerings;  fluctuations  in  foreign  exchange  rates; inflation and other macroeconomic pressures; the imposition of new or increased tariffs and other trade restrictions, their overall magnitude and duration, and retaliatory actions in response; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with lower profit margins. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company's results of operations, financial condition and stock price.

The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline  in  demand  for  that  product  could  significantly  impact  quarterly  net  sales.  The  Company  could  also  be  subject  to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company's products or services, issues with new product or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or a change in or failure of one or more of the Company's logistics, supply or manufacturing partners.

## Varied  stakeholder  expectations  about  social  and  other  issues  expose  the  Company  to  potential  liabilities,  increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on the Company's business.

Various stakeholders, including governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and others, have differing expectations about a wide range of social and other issues related to the Company's business. The Company makes statements about  its  values,  including  the  environmental  and  societal  impact  of  its  business,  through  various  non-financial  reports, information provided on the Company's website, and in press statements and other communications. The Company also pursues environmental and other goals and initiatives that involve risks and uncertainties, require investments, and depend in part on third-party performance or data that is outside the Company's control, and there can be no assurance that the Company will fully achieve all  of  its  goals  and  initiatives.  Efforts  by  the  Company  to  advance  its  business  and  values,  or  achieve  its  goals  and further its initiatives, or to align with stakeholders' expectations, or comply with evolving, varied and at times conflicting federal, state  and  international  laws,  regulations  and  standards,  or  any  failure  or  perceived  failure  to  do  so,  can  result  in  adverse reactions by consumers and other stakeholders, including the commencement of legal and regulatory proceedings against the Company, and can materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.
