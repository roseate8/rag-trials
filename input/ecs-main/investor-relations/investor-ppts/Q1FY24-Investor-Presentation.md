This presentation and the accompanying oral presentation contain forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties, which include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our expected financial results for the fiscal quarter ending October 31, 2023 and the fiscal year ending April 30, 2024, our strategic areas of focus, expectations and plans regarding our future growth, our go-to-market and growth strategies and the effectiveness of such strategies, assessments of our strategic partnerships, the expected performance or benefits of our offerings, our assessments of our competitive advantages, the strength of and demand for our solutions and products, and growth opportunities, and our ability to address those opportunities. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements due to uncertainties, risks, and changes in circumstances, including but not limited to those related to: our future financial performance, including our expectations regarding our revenue, cost of revenue, gross profit or gross margin, operating expenses (which include changes in sales and marketing, research and development and general and administrative expenses), and our ability to achieve and maintain future profitability; our ability to continue to deliver and improve our offerings and develop new offerings (including innovations around AI use cases); customer acceptance and purchase of our new and existing offerings; the expansion and adoption of our Elastic Cloud offerings; our ability to realize value from investments in the business; our ability to maintain and expand our user and customer base; the impact of the uncertain macroeconomic environment and ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine on our business, operations, hiring and financial results, and on businesses and spending priorities of our customers and partners; bank failures; the impact of our pricing model strategies on our business; the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and the uncertain inflation and interest rate environment on our results; our international expansion strategy; our operating results and cash flows; the sufficiency of our capital resources; our ability to successfully execute our go-to-market strategy, our forecasts regarding our business; and general market, political, economic and business conditions.

Any additional or unforeseen effect from the uncertain macroeconomic environment or ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine may exacerbate these risks. Additional risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially are included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 'SEC'), including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2023 and subsequent reports filed with the SEC.

'The expertise of Elastic in enterprise search is evident in the way the company thinks about how to incorporate generative AI into it. We're working closely together to help companies leverage the power of Azure OpenAI and ChatGPT over all of an organization's proprietary data in Elasticsearch to help our joint customers deliver a richer and more seamless experience.'

President of Microsoft's Developer Division Julia Liuson

'Ensuring our customers and partners have industry-leading search capabilities is vital to our mission to help them organize data, discover the truth and act on it. To that end, I'm thrilled about the benefits we can bring to customers through our investments to harness Elasticsearch within RelativityOne. We're experimenting with ESRE right now and are excited about its potential to deliver powerful, AI-augmented search results to our customers."

Chief Product Officer at Relativity Chris Brown

'Enterprises are excited about the potential for generative AI in their applications and workflows, but are all also swamped by the pace of innovation in the field. ESRE is designed to ease adoption of transformers, homemade and third-party LLM models, building on the original core strengths of Elastic in search.' Co-founder of RedMonk

See appendix for reconciliation. A reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance measures to corresponding GAAP measures for operating margin and net earnings/(loss) per share is not available on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort due to the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, many of the costs and expenses that may be incurred in the future. These items necessary to reconcile such non-GAAP measures could be material and have a significant impact on the Company's results computed in accordance with GAAP.

Adjusted free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities adjusted for cash paid for interest less cash used for investing activities for purchases of property and equipment, and capitalized internal-use software costs. Adjusted free cash flow margin is calculated as adjusted free cash flow divided by total revenue. Adjusted free cash flow does not represent residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures since, among other things, we have mandatory debt service requirements.
