## Table of Contents

## Summary of Risks Affecting our Business

The following is a summary of the key risks and uncertainties associated with our business, industry, and ownership of our ordinary shares. The summary below does not contain all of the information that may be important to you, and you should read this summary together with the more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties we face, which are set forth in Part I, 'Item 1A- Risk Factors' in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

- If we do not appropriately manage our future growth or are unable to improve our systems and processes, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.
- We have a history of losses and may not be able to achieve profitability or positive operating cash flow on a consistent basis.
- Information technology ('IT') spending, sales cycles, and other factors affecting the demand for our offerings and our results of operations have been, and may continue to be, negatively impacted by current macroeconomic conditions, including declining rates of economic growth, inflationary pressures, increased interest rates, and other conditions discussed in this report, and by the evolving conflict in Israel and Gaza and Russia's war with Ukraine.
- We may not be successful in our artificial intelligence initiatives, and social, ethical, and regulatory issues relating to the use of AI in our offerings may result in new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, reputational harm, damage to our competitive position, and liability.
- We and our third-party vendors are vulnerable to cybersecurity risks, including phishing attacks, viruses, malware, ransomware, hacking, or similar incidents that may disrupt or damage our business.
- Our ability to grow our business will suffer if we do not expand and increase adoption of our Elastic Cloud offerings.
- Our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter.
- Our future growth, business and results of operations will be harmed if we are not able to keep pace with technological and competitive developments, increase sales of our subscriptions to new and existing customers, renew existing customers' subscriptions, increase adoption of our cloud-based offerings, respond effectively to evolving markets or offer high-quality support services.
- Our limited history with consumption-based arrangements for our Elastic Cloud offerings is not adequate to enable us to accurately predict the longterm rate of customer adoption or renewal, or the impact those arrangements will have on our near-term or long-term revenue and operating results.
- Because we recognize the vast majority of our revenue from subscriptions, downturns or upturns in sales are not immediately reflected in full in our results of operations.
- We may not be able to effectively develop and expand our sales, marketing and customer support capabilities.
- If our partners, including cloud providers, systems integrators, channel partners, referral partners, original equipment manufacturing and managed service provider partners, and technology partners, fail to perform or we are unable to maintain successful relationships with them, our ability to market, sell, and distribute our solution may be limited.
- We may not be able to realize the benefits of our marketing strategies where we offer some of our product features free of charge and provide free trials to some of our paid features.
- Our international business exposes us to a variety of risks, and if we are not successful in sustaining and expanding our international business, we may incur additional losses and our revenue growth could be harmed.
- We are subject to risks associated with our receipt of revenue from sales to government entities.
- Our decision to no longer offer Elasticsearch and Kibana under an open source license may harm the adoption of those products.
- We could be negatively impacted if the Elastic License or the Server Side Public License Version 1.0 ('SSPL') under which some of our software is licensed is not enforceable.
- Our reputation could be harmed if third parties offer inadequate or defective implementations of software that we have previously made available under an open source license.
- Limited technological barriers to entry into the markets in which we compete may facilitate entry by other enterprises into our markets to compete with us.
- A real or perceived defect, security vulnerability, error, or performance failure in our software could cause us to lose revenue, damage our reputation, and expose us to financial liability.

## Table of Contents

- Interruptions or performance problems, and our reliance on technologies from third parties, may adversely affect our business operations and financial results.
- Incorrect implementation or use of our software could negatively affect our business, operations, financial results, and growth prospects.
- Failure to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights could substantially harm our business and results of operations.
- We could incur substantial costs as a result of any claim of infringement, misappropriation or violation of another party's intellectual property rights, including as a result of the indemnity provisions in various agreements.
- Our use of third-party open source software within our products could negatively affect our ability to sell our products and subject us to litigation.
- An investment in our company is subject to tax risks based on our status as a non-U.S. corporation.
- Any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with regulations or any other obligations relating to privacy, data protection or information security could adversely affect our business.
- Our business is subject to a variety of government and industry regulations, as well as other obligations, including compliance with export control, trade sanctions, anti-bribery, anti-corruption, and anti-money laundering laws.
- The market price for our ordinary shares has been and is likely to continue to be volatile.
- The concentration of our share ownership with insiders will likely limit your ability to influence corporate matters.
- Dutch law and our articles of association include anti-takeover provisions, which may impact the value of our ordinary shares.
- Claims of U.S. civil liabilities may not be enforceable against us.
- If industry or financial analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue inaccurate or unfavorable research regarding our ordinary shares, our share price and trading volume could decline.

## PART I

## Item 1. Business

Elastic, the Search AI Company, enables our customers to find the answers they need in real time, using all of their data, at scale. The Elastic Search AI Platform ('our platform'), combines the power of search with AI to help companies solve real-time business problems, unlock potential value, and achieve better outcomes. Our platform, available as both a hosted, managed service across public clouds as well as self-managed software, allows our customers to find insights and drive AI and machine learning use cases from large amounts of data.

We offer three search-powered solutions - Search, Observability, and Security - that are built on the platform. We help organizations, their employees, and their customers find what they need faster, while keeping mission-critical applications running smoothly, and protecting against cyber threats.

As digital transformation drives mission-critical business functions to the cloud, we believe that every company must incorporate search AI capabilities across IT and line-of-business organizations to find the answers that matter from all of its data in real-time and at scale.

Our platform is built on the Elastic Stack, a powerful set of software products that ingest data from any source, in any format, and perform search, analysis, and visualization of that data. At the core of the Elastic Stack is Elasticsearch - a highly scalable document store and search engine, and the unified data store for all of our solutions and use cases. Another component of the Elastic Stack is Kibana, which delivers a common user interface across all of our solutions, with powerful drag-and-drop visual analytics, and centralized management of the platform. Our platform also includes the Elasticsearch Relevance Engine™ ('ESRE'), which combines advanced AI with Elastic's text search to give developers a full suite of sophisticated retrieval algorithms and the ability to integrate with large language models. Our out-of-the-box solutions deliver fast time to value for common use cases and, paired with our developer-centric platform which is extensible and customizable, allow us to innovate fast and differentiate our offerings at every level.

We make our platform available as a hosted, managed service across major cloud providers (Amazon Web Services ('AWS'), Google Cloud Platform ('GCP'), and Microsoft Azure) in more than 55 public cloud regions globally. Customers can also deploy our platform across hybrid clouds, public or private clouds, and multi-cloud environments.

Our business model is based primarily on a combination of a paid Elastic-managed hosted service offering and paid and free proprietary self-managed software. Our paid offerings for our platform are sold via subscription through resource-based pricing, and all customers and users have access to varying levels of features across all solutions. In Elastic Cloud, our family of cloud-based offerings, we offer various subscription tiers tied to different features. For users who download our software, we make some of the features of our software available free of charge, allowing us to engage with a broad community of developers and practitioners and introduce them to the value of the Elastic Stack. We believe in the importance of an open software development model, and we develop the majority of our software in public repositories as open code under a proprietary license. Unlike some companies, we do not build an enterprise version that is separate from our free distribution. We maintain a single code base across both our self-managed software and Elastic-hosted services. All of these actions help us build a powerful commercial business model that we believe is optimized for product-driven growth.

Our customers often significantly expand their usage of our products and services over time. Expansion includes increasing the number of developers and practitioners using our products, increasing the utilization of our products for a particular use case, and utilizing our products to address new use cases. We focus some of our direct sales efforts on encouraging this type of expansion within our customer base, both within as well as across solutions. Because our business model provides access to all solutions with resource-based pricing, we make it easy for customers to expand across use cases.

Our business has experienced rapid growth around the world. As of April 30, 2024, we had approximately 21,000 customers compared to approximately 20,200 customers and over 18,600 customers as of April 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our total revenue was $1.267 billion, $1.069 billion, and $862.4 million for the years ended April 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 19% for the year ended April 30, 2024 and 24% for the year ended April 30, 2023. Subscriptions accounted for 93%, 92% and 93% of our total revenue for the years ended April 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Revenue from outside the United States accounted for 42%, 41% and 44% of our total revenue for the years ended April 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

While we recorded net income of $61.7 million for the year ended April 30, 2024, we incurred net losses of $236.2 million and $203.8 million for the years ended April 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Although we recorded net income for the year ended April 30, 2024, we expect to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. Our net cash provided by operating activities was $148.8 million, $35.7 million, and $5.7 million for the years ended April 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022 respectively.

## Technology Features of the Elastic Stack

Elasticsearch is the heart of the Elastic Stack, where users store, search, and analyze data. Key features of Elasticsearch include the following:

- Storage of any type of data. Elasticsearch combines powerful parts of traditional search engines, such as an inverted index to power fast full-text search and a column store for analytics, with native support for a wide range of data types, including text, dates, numbers, geospatial data, date/numeric ranges, and IP addresses. With sensible defaults, and no upfront schema definition necessary, Elasticsearch makes it easy to start with simple storage solutions and fine-tune them as datasets grow.
- Vector search. Elastic natively supports vector search as part of ESRE, which enables a wide range of advanced search use cases that improve relevance, including sophisticated search ranking, image search, question answering, and more. Vector search relies on a next generation of machine learning models that can represent many types of content as vectors, including text, images, events, and more. ESRE also supports integration with large language models. As data volumes and formats proliferate, this sophisticated approach to search and relevance is becoming important for use cases where delivering maximum relevance is critical.
- Machine learning, AI, and alerting. Machine learning capabilities such as anomaly detection, forecasting, and categorization are tightly integrated with the Elastic Stack to automatically model the behavior of data, such as trends and periodicity, in real time to identify issues faster, streamline root cause analysis, and reduce false positives. Without these capabilities, it can be very difficult to identify issues such as infrastructure problems or intruders in real time across complex, high-volume, fast-moving datasets. In the last few years, we have also added native support for vector search and model management for advanced machine learning models.
- Powerful query languages. The Elasticsearch query domain specific language is a flexible, expressive search language that exposes a rich set of query capabilities across any kind of data. From simple Boolean operators to custom relevance functions, users can articulate exactly what they are looking for and bring their own definition of relevance. The query language also includes a composable aggregation framework that enables users to summarize, disaggregate, and analyze structured or semi-structured datasets across multiple dimensions. Examples of these capabilities, all with a single search, include tracking the top ten users by expenditure level, looking at data week over week, analyzing data across geographies, and drilling down into details with specific filters.
- Developer friendliness. Elasticsearch has consistent, well-documented application programming interfaces ('APIs') that work the same way on one node during initial development as on a hundred nodes in production. Elasticsearch also ships with a number of language clients that provide a natural way to integrate with a variety of popular programming frameworks, reducing the learning curve, and leading to a shorter time to realizing value.
- High speed. Everything stored in Elasticsearch is indexed by default, so users do not need to decide in advance what queries they will want to run. Our architecture optimizes throughput, time-to-data availability and query latency. Elasticsearch can index millions of events per second, and newly added data can be available for search nearly instantly.

## Table of Contents

- High scale and availability. Elasticsearch is designed to scale horizontally and be resilient to node or hardware failures. As nodes join a cluster, data is automatically re-balanced and queries and indexing are spread across the new nodes seamlessly. This makes it easy to add hardware to increase indexing throughput or improve query throughput. Elasticsearch also detects node failures and hardware or network issues and automatically protects user data by eliminating the failing or inaccessible nodes and creating new replicas of the data.
- Security. Security features give administrators the rights to grant specific levels of access to their various types of users, such as IT, operations, and application teams. Elasticsearch serves as the central authentication hub for the entire Elastic Stack. Security features include encrypted communications and encryption-at-rest; role-based access control; single sign-on and authentication; field-level, attribute-level, and documentlevel security; and audit logging.

Kibana is the user interface for the Elastic Stack. It allows users to manage the Elastic Stack and visualize data. Additionally, the interfaces for many of our solutions are built into Kibana. Key features of Kibana include the following:

- Exploration and visualization of data stored in Elasticsearch. Kibana provides interactive data views, visualizations, and dashboards powered by structured filtering and unstructured search to enable users to get to answers more quickly. Diverse user needs are supported by a variety of data visualization types, such as simple line and bar charts, purpose-built geospatial and time series visualizations, tree diagrams, network diagrams, heatmaps, scatter plots, and histograms.
- Incorporation of advanced analytics and machine learning from Elasticsearch. Kibana's query, filtering, and data summarization capabilities reflect Elasticsearch's powerful query domain specific language and aggregation framework while making it interactive.
- Management of the Elastic Stack. Kibana presents a broad user interface showing the health of Elastic Stack components and provides cluster alerts to notify administrators of problems. Its central management user interfaces make it easier to operate the Elastic Stack at scale.
- Home for solutions. Kibana is where our users and customers access the user interfaces for our Search, Observability, and Security solutions. Kibana provides core services, like security, alerting, and data visualization components. This makes it easy for users to discover all of the capabilities our solutions provide and enables solution users to benefit from Kibana's core capabilities.
- Application framework. Kibana is designed to be extensible. Users interested in a highly specialized visualization type not distributed with Kibana by default can customize experiences through a Kibana plugin and make the plugin available to the community. Dozens of Kibana plugins have been shared by the community via Elastic documentation and code sharing platforms such as GitHub.

Elastic Agent, Beats, and Logstash are data ingestion tools that enable users to collect and enrich any kind of data from any source for storage in Elasticsearch. Beats and Logstash have an extensible modular architecture. Elastic Agent is a single, unified way to add monitoring for logs, metrics, and other types of data to each host, and also includes integrated host protection and central management. Beats are lightweight agents purpose-built for collecting data on devices, servers, and inside containers. Key features include the following:

Our team extends beyond our employee base. It includes all the users who download our software. Our users interact with us on our website forums and on X (formerly known as Twitter), GitHub, Stack Overflow, Quora, Facebook, and other platforms.

In order to build products that best meet our users' needs, we focus on, and invest in, building a strong community. Each download of the Elastic Stack is a new opportunity to educate our next contributor, hear about a new use case, explore the need for a new feature, or meet a future member of the team. Community is core to our identity, binding our products closely together with our users. Community gives us the ability to get their candid feedback, creating a direct line of communication between our users and the builders of our products across all of our features - including both free and paid capabilities - and enabling us to make our products simpler and better.

The Elastic community has a code of conduct that covers the behaviors of the Elastic community in any forum, mailing list, wiki, website, code repository, Slack channel, private correspondence, or public meeting. It is designed to ensure that the Elastic community is a space where members and users can freely and openly communicate, collaborate, and contribute both ideas and code. This Elastic Community code of conduct also covers our community ground rules: be considerate, be patient, be respectful, be nice, communicate effectively, and ask for help when unsure.

## Competition

Our market is highly competitive, quickly evolving, fragmented, and subject to rapid changes in technology, shifting customer needs, and frequent introductions of new offerings. Our principal competitors include:

- For Search and other platform use cases: offerings such as Lucidworks Fusion and Apache Solr (open source offering), search tools including Algolia, Coveo, and Google.
- For Observability: software vendors with specific observability solutions to analyze logging data, metrics, APM data, or infrastructure uptime, such as AppDynamics (owned by Cisco Systems), Datadog, Dynatrace, New Relic, and Splunk (owned by Cisco Systems).

## Table of Contents

- For Security: security vendors such as Azure Sentinel (by Microsoft), Broadcom (which owns Carbon Black and Symantec), CrowdStrike, McAfee, and Splunk (owned by Cisco Systems).
- Certain cloud hosting providers and managed service providers, including AWS, that offer products or services based on a forked version of the Elastic Stack. These offerings are not supported by Elastic and come without any of Elastic's proprietary features, whether free or paid.

The principal competitive factors for companies in our industry are:

- product capabilities, including speed, scale, and relevance, with which to power search AI experiences;
- an extensible product 'stack' that enables developers to build a wide variety of solutions;
- powerful and flexible technology that can manage a broad variety and large volume of data;
- ease of deployment and ease of use;
- ability to address a variety of evolving customer needs and use cases;
- strength and execution of sales and marketing strategies;
- flexible deployment model across public or private clouds, hybrid environments, or multi-cloud environments;
- productized solutions engineered to be rapidly adopted to address specific applications;
- mindshare with developers and IT and security executives;
- adoption of products by many types of users and decision makers (developers, architects, DevOps personnel, IT professionals, security analysts, and departmental and organizational leaders);
- enterprise-grade technology that is secure and reliable;
- size of customer base and level of user adoption;
- quality of training, consulting, and customer support;
- brand awareness and reputation; and
- low total cost of ownership.

We believe that we compare favorably to our competitors on the basis of the factors listed above. However, compared to us, many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, greater brand recognition, larger sales forces and marketing budgets, broader distribution networks and presence, more established relationships with current or potential customers and partners, more diverse product and services offerings, and larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios. Our competitors may be able to leverage these resources to gain business in a manner that discourages customers from purchasing our offerings.

We expect that our industry will continue to attract new companies, including smaller emerging companies, which could introduce new offerings. We may also expand into new markets and encounter additional competitors in such markets.

While our products and solutions have various competitors across different use cases, such as search applications and workplace search, logging, metrics, APM, business analytics and security analytics, we believe that few competitors currently have the capabilities to address our entire range of use cases. We believe our industry requires constant change and innovation, and we plan to continue to evolve search as a foundational technology to solve the problems of today and new emerging problems in the future.

## Intellectual Property

We rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, registered and unregistered trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements with third parties, and other contractual measures to safeguard our core technology and other intellectual property assets. In addition, we maintain a policy requiring our employees, contractors, and consultants to enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements. As of April 30, 2024, we had a number of active patents, issued in both the United States and outside of the United States, with expirations ranging from 2031 to 2042. In addition, as of April 30, 2024, we had numerous U.S. and international trademark registrations.

The laws, procedures and restrictions on which we rely may provide only limited protection, and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated. In addition, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions, and we therefore may be unable to protect our proprietary technology in certain jurisdictions.

## Table of Contents

In addition, our technology incorporates software components licensed to the general public under open source software licenses such as the Apache Software License Version 2.0 ('Apache 2.0'). We obtain many components from software developed and released by contributors for independent open source components of our technology. Open source licenses grant licensees broad permissions to use, copy, modify and redistribute our platform. As a result, open source development and licensing practices can limit the value of our software copyright assets.

For additional information about risks relating to our intellectual property, see the section titled 'Risk Factors-Risks Related to our Business and Industry' in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

## Human Capital Management

We believe that our employees (whom we call 'Elasticians') and our culture are vital to Elastic's long-term success. We support both with human capital management efforts focused on:

- Attracting, engaging and retaining a talented and diverse employee base
- Maintaining our strong company culture
- Enhancing our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion ('DEI')
- Facilitating strong employee engagement
- Promoting continuous employee learning and development
- Providing a comprehensive total rewards package that seeks to offer fair and consistent pay practices with an emphasis on employee well-being

Our management regularly updates our board of directors and its committees on human capital trends and employee-focused activities and initiatives.

As of April 30, 2024, we had a total of 3,187 employees in over 35 countries globally. Over 30% of our workforce consists of women and employees who self-identify as non-binary. None of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor union. In certain countries, we have works councils or follow statutory requirements for employee representation through industry-wide collective bargaining agreements.

## Distributed Workforce

Elastic originated as a distributed company and continues to be distributed by design. We have built our processes, systems, and teams so that employees can generally perform their jobs without needing to be physically present in the same room - or even in the same time zone - as their colleagues. Just as distributed systems are more resilient, we believe that a distributed workforce helps build a strong company that can scale and adapt as new challenges arise. Our distributed model also expands our reach to a global candidate pool, broadening our ability to attract diverse talent across regions.

## Diversity, Equity and Inclusion

Our focus on DEI is critical to how we develop, strengthen and sustain a sense of belonging and inclusion among all employees.

Balanced Teams. We strive to be an employer of choice for a diverse and inclusive workforce through our talent brand, talent attraction, development, and retention efforts. Our recruiting approach is underpinned by the desire to create balanced teams at Elastic, which includes considering broad aspects of diversity - not only race and gender, but also diversity of thought, experience and tenure. We believe in empowering our employees to be their whole, creative selves and are proud to see this work recognized by Comparably, a workplace culture and compensation review platform, in nine major categories of its 2023 Best Place to Work series, including: Best Company Culture, Best CEO for Diversity, and Best Company Work-Life Balance. We also received an A+ culture score from Comparably.

Elastician Resource Groups. We strive to embed DEI deep within our culture through various initiatives, projects, and programs, the centerpiece of which is our Elastician Resource Groups ('ERGs'), which are company-sponsored, self-organized, employee-run groups aligned with specific shared identities, interests, affinity or allyship. Our seven ERGs encompass: Accessibility, Black and African American, Asian and Pacific Islander+, Hispanic/Latinx, LGBTQIA+, Military/Veteran, and Women.

## Table of Contents

Fair Pay Practices. Fair pay is the foundation of our compensation philosophy and the goal of fair pay informs our pay decisions around the globe. This means paying people fairly for the job they perform without regard to gender, race, or ethnicity. We partner with an external firm to conduct pay equity analysis on a regular basis using established job groupings and control factors to promote appropriate comparisons. We look at gender globally and race and ethnicity for employees in the U.S. Additionally, outside of the United States, we conduct supplemental country-specific analysis in accordance with local requirements. Further recognizing that transparency is fundamental in fostering an equitable workplace where employees can trust that their compensation is based on fair and objective criteria, we provide all employees with information about the full salary range for their role. Throughout the United States and Canada, we also include salary ranges on all job postings, in all states and provinces.

Code of Conduct . To promote and reinforce our high standards of ethics and integrity throughout the entire company, we require all employees to acknowledge their compliance with our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and complete mandatory training on this code, and on whistleblowing, antiharassment, discrimination, anti-retaliation, and other key policies and standards.

## Employee Engagement

We are committed to ensuring that our employees have a voice and the opportunity to share their ideas and insights. Through their collective experiences and feedback, our employees play a key role in enhancing our workplace environment.

We formally seek employee feedback through regular employee experience surveys. We monitor employee morale and attitudes through two primary feedback mechanisms, consisting of - an annual employee engagement survey and a mid-year pulse survey check-in. In fiscal 2024, our employees demonstrated high engagement with robust participation in the employee experience survey. The results of these surveys are reviewed at the company, functional, team, and manager level, and are used to develop action plans.

## Learning and Development

Elastic's Learning &amp; Organizational Development (L&amp;OD) team's vision is to enable purposeful growth for all employees by providing meaningful learning that can be applied in work and life. Our L&amp;OD team's mission is to enable employees by providing the opportunity to pursue their purpose, in work and life. To that end, we engage across a variety of mediums to ways in which we support the continuous learning and development of all Elasticians, including anytime access to on-demand video based learning and other opportunities.

We also conduct specific programs to develop managers and leaders at Elastic, including an externally-led leadership development program focused on high-performing leaders who possess the potential to have a significant strategic impact on the achievement of our long-term objectives.

## Total Rewards

Compensation, Benefits and Well-being . We aim to provide all employees with a total rewards package that is market-competitive, emphasizing global consistency and local relevance. Compensation typically includes equity in the form of restricted stock units in addition to cash. Reflecting our interest in the whole person, we provide benefit programs designed to enable employees to meet their well-being goals, from starting a family to being at their physical and emotional best. These programs generally include core offerings of healthcare coverage and income protection plans, along with a focus on mental health and well-being. We provide market-competitive paid time off programs, which feature 16 weeks of paid leave to all new parents, along with life-planning benefits. In addition, we provide retirement savings plans, including a company-matched 401k plan for our U.S.-based employees. Outside of the United States, we offer plans aligned to local market practice. We also have adopted an employee stock purchase plan in which employees in countries are able to participate.

Flexible Work Environment . As a distributed company, most employees have the flexibility to work anywhere provided that we have an established structure and it aligns with the needs of the business and their role. We also recognize the importance of face-to-face interaction and maintain physical offices around the world to provide a space for employees to work and collaborate in a manner that fits their needs and preferences.

Community Involvement. Through our Elastic Cares program, employees can support the charitable organizations that matter most to them on a local and global level. This program encompasses donation matching, our nonprofit organization program which provides our technology for free to certain nonprofit organizations, and our volunteer time off initiative. Employees are encouraged to volunteer throughout the year with nonprofit organizations of their choosing using our volunteer time-off program, which provides our employees with 40 hours of paid volunteer time each year. Employees who volunteer outside of their scheduled work day can also log their hours to earn donation credit which they can direct back to the cause of their choice.

## Government Regulations

Our worldwide business activities are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations of the United States as well as of foreign governments. Our compliance with existing or future governmental regulations, including, but not limited to, those pertaining to global trade, business acquisitions, consumer and data protection, and taxes, could have material impacts on our business. See Item 1A, 'Risk Factors' of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of these potential impacts.

## Item 1A. Risk Factors

A description of the risks and uncertainties associated with our business, industry and ownership of our ordinary shares is set forth below. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that could affect us. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the price of our ordinary shares could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment. In addition, major geopolitical events, including any worsening of the macroeconomic environment, may exacerbate the risks described below, any of which could have a material impact on us and additional impacts that are currently not known to us may arise.

## Risks Related to our Business and Industry

Our business and operations have experienced rapid growth, and if we do not appropriately manage future growth, if any, or are unable to improve our systems and processes, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects may be adversely affected.

We have experienced rapid growth and increased demand for our offerings. Our number of customers has increased significantly over the past several years, with our total number of customers growing from over 2,800 as of April 30, 2017 to approximately 21,000 as of April 30, 2024. The growth and expansion of our business and offerings place a continuous and significant strain on our management, operational, and financial resources. In addition, as customers adopt our technology for an increasing number of use cases, we have had to support more complex commercial relationships. We may not be able to leverage, develop and retain qualified employees effectively enough to maintain our growth plans. We must continue to improve our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems, our relationships with various partners and other third parties, and our ability to manage headcount and processes in an efficient manner to manage our growth effectively. Our failure to do so could result in increased costs, negatively affect our customers' satisfaction with our offerings, and harm our results of operations.

## Table of Contents

## We have a history of losses and may not be able to achieve profitability or positive operating cash flow on a consistent basis.

We incurred a net loss of $236.2 million and $203.8 million for the years ended April 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and have incurred losses in all prior years since our inception. As a result, we had an accumulated deficit of $991.6 million as of April 30, 2024. Although we had net income of $61.7 million for the year ended April 30, 2024, we expect to incur net losses in future years. We anticipate that our operating expenses will continue to increase substantially in the foreseeable future as we continue to enhance our offerings, broaden our customer base and pursue larger transactions, expand our sales and marketing activities, expand our operations, hire additional employees, and continue to develop our technology. These efforts may prove more expensive than we currently anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenue sufficiently, or at all, to offset these higher expenses. Revenue growth may slow or revenue may decline for a number of reasons, including slowing demand for our offerings, increasing competition, or economic downturns, including as a result of rising rates of inflation and other macroeconomic events. You should not consider our revenue growth in prior periods as indicative of our future performance. Any failure to increase our revenue or grow our business could prevent us from achieving profitability at all or on a consistent basis, which would cause our business, financial condition, and results of operations to suffer. Additionally, although we generated positive operating cash flow in fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, any failure to grow our business could prevent us from achieving positive operating cash flow on a consistent basis, which could cause our business, financial condition, and results of operations to suffer.

## Unfavorable or uncertain conditions in our industry or the global economy or reductions in information technology spending, including as a result of adverse macroeconomic conditions, or the evolving conflict in Israel and Gaza and Russia's war with Ukraine, could limit our ability to grow our business and negatively affect our results of operations.

Our results of operations may vary based on the impact of changes in our industry or the global economy on us or our customers. Current, future, or sustained economic uncertainties or downturns, whether actual or perceived, could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Negative conditions in the general economy both in the United States and in international markets, including conditions resulting from changes in gross domestic product growth, financial and credit market fluctuations, international trade relations, changes in inflation, foreign exchange and interest rate environments, recessionary fears, supply chain constraints, energy costs, political instability, natural catastrophes, warfare, infectious diseases and terrorist attacks, could cause a decrease in business investments by our customers and potential customers, including spending on information technology, and negatively affect the growth of our business. For example, inflation rates recently reached levels not seen in decades and have continued to create economic volatility as governments adjust interest rates in an attempt to manage the inflationary environment, which may further lead to our customers tightening their technology expenditures and investment. Further, the ongoing international political crisis resulting from the evolving conflict in Israel and Gaza and Russia's war with Ukraine could continue to have significant negative macroeconomic consequences, including on the businesses of our customers, which could negatively impact their spending on our offerings. Any further disruptions or other adverse developments, or concerns or rumors about any such events or similar risks, in the financial services industry, both in the U.S. and in international markets, may lead to market-wide liquidity problems and may impact our or our customers' liquidity and, as a result, negatively affect the level of customer spending on our offerings.

As a result of the foregoing conditions, our revenue may be disproportionately affected by longer and more unpredictable sales cycles, delays or reductions in customer consumption or in general information technology spending, and further impacts of changing foreign exchange rates. Further, current and prospective customers may choose to develop in-house software as an alternative to using our paid products. These factors could increase the amount of customer churn we have experienced recently and further slow consumption and overall customer expenditure. Moreover, competitors may respond to market conditions by lowering prices. If the economic conditions of the general economy or markets in which we operate do not improve, or worsen from present levels, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.

## We may not be successful in our artificial intelligence initiatives, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.

AI presents new risks and challenges that may affect our business. We have made, and expect to continue to make, continued investments to integrate AI and machine learning technology into our offerings, including increasing our technical operations and engineering in these applications. Rapid technological progress in the industry regarding new and emerging AI technologies, such as generative AI, may require additional investment in the development, integration, and maintenance of our product offerings, as well as the development of appropriate technical protections and safeguards to maintain a responsible and ethical AI framework. These requirements may add costs and could increase our expenses as we continue to expand the breadth of use and applications of AI technologies, including generative AI, further into our product offerings, or to address changes to AI technologies, frameworks, or regulations. Additionally, we may incur substantial costs in our sales and marketing efforts to promote and sell our offerings based on AI technologies, including but not limited to branding, product promotion, and demand generation as well as technical training and investments in resources for our sales personnel and partners. Despite such

## Table of Contents

investments in building our product offerings and in sales and marketing, our product offerings may not be adopted by customers. We may not achieve significant revenue directly related to all of our AI-related initiatives for several years, if at all.

Further, AI presents risks, challenges, and unintended consequences that could affect our ability to continue to incorporate the use of AI successfully in our business and solutions in new and novel ways. In addition, given the complex nature of AI technology, we face an evolving regulatory landscape and significant competition from other companies. Competitors may incorporate AI into their products more quickly or more successfully than we do, which could impair our ability to compete effectively and adversely affect our financial results. Data practices by us or others that result in controversy could also impair the acceptance of AI solutions, which could undermine confidence in the decisions, predictions, analysis, or other content that our AI-related initiatives produce. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.

## Social, ethical, and regulatory issues relating to the use of AI and similar evolving technologies in our offerings may result in new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, reputational harm, damage to our competitive position, and liability.

We have invested in and plan to continue to invest in the research and development of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies, including generative AI. We view our continued investment in AI and generative AI research and development as an opportunity to enhance our products and services, strengthen our competitive advantage, and contribute to the responsible advancement of AI and generative AI technology. While we aim to do so in a responsible manner, social, ethical, regulatory, and legal issues relating to the use of new and evolving technologies such as AI and generative AI in our offerings may result in reputational harm and liability, as well as failures in regulatory compliance, and may cause us to incur additional research, development, and compliance costs. We are increasingly building into many of our offerings new software for integrating and creating the opportunity for our customers to integrate themselves as well as existing AI and generative AI tools in the market. As with many innovations, AI and generative AI present risks that could affect its adoption and contribution to our business. If we enable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on society, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm, or legal liability.

Government regulation related to AI and generative AI use and ethics may also increase the burden and cost of research and development, testing, and maintenance and delay implementation of these technologies. The rapid evolution of AI will require the application of resources to develop, test and maintain our products and services to help ensure that AI and generative AI are implemented in a way that minimizes unintended, potentially harmful, or adverse impacts. It is possible that further laws and regulations will be adopted, or that existing laws and regulations may be interpreted, in ways that would affect our business and the ways in which we, our partners, and customers or potential customers use AI and machine learning technology, which may impact their use adoption of our solutions and may adversely affect our financial condition and our results of operations, including as a result of costs we incur to comply with such laws or regulations.

## If we experience a security incident, or unauthorized access to or other unauthorized processing of confidential information, including personal data, otherwise occurs, our software may be perceived as not being secure, customers may reduce the use of or stop using our products, and we may incur significant liabilities.

In the normal course of our business, we receive, collect, manage, store, transmit and otherwise process large amounts of proprietary information and confidential data, including personal data and other sensitive information, relating to our operations, products, customers and business partners. Any cybersecurity incident affecting our networks, systems or those on which we rely could result in our loss of confidential information, including personal data, disruption to our operations, significant remediation costs, lost revenue, increased insurance premiums, damage to our reputation, litigation, regulatory investigations, fines, or other liabilities. We face sophisticated and evolving cyber threats from individual hackers, criminal groups, and state-sponsored organizations, as well as risks that employees, contractors or other insiders, particularly those with connectivity to our systems, may introduce vulnerabilities into our environments, facilitate a cyber attack, or take action to misappropriate our intellectual property and proprietary information.

As a provider of security solutions, we have been and may continue to be specifically targeted by threat actors for attacks intended to circumvent our security capabilities as an entry point into customers' endpoints, networks, or systems. Our industry continues to see a large volume of unauthorized scans of systems searching for vulnerabilities or misconfigurations to exploit. Attempted cyber attacks of our systems can deploy such malicious techniques, among others, as phishing, ransomware, credential stuffing, distributed denial of service, network intrusions, malware, domain name system spoofing, exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities, and structural query language injection. While our security systems and controls have successfully protected us against, and mitigated the impacts of, many past attacks of this nature, we expect that we will experience similar incidents in the future.

## Table of Contents

If our security measures are compromised, we may face a loss in intellectual property protection, our data, or our customers' data, and our reputation may be damaged, our business may suffer, and we could be subject to claims, demands, regulatory investigations, and other proceedings and indemnity obligations and otherwise incur significant liability. Even the perception of inadequate security or an inability to maintain security certifications, maintain a security program in line with industry standards, or to comply with our customer or user agreements, contracts with third-party vendors or service providers or other contracts may damage our reputation, cause a loss of confidence in our security solutions and negatively affect our ability to win new customers and retain existing customers. Further, we could be required to expend significant capital and other resources to address any security incident, and we may face difficulties or delays in identifying and responding to any cybersecurity incident. If our systems or networks or those on which we rely suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we could experience delays in reporting our financial results, and we may lose revenue and profits as a result of our inability to timely produce, distribute, invoice and collect payments for our products and services.

In addition, many of our customers may use our software for processing their confidential information, including business strategies, financial and operational data, personal information and other related data. As a result, unauthorized access to or use of our software or such data could result in the loss, compromise, corruption or destruction of our customers' confidential information. Such access or use could also hinder our ability to obtain and maintain information security certifications that support customers' adoption of our products and our retention of those customers. We expect to continue incurring significant costs in connection with our implementation of administrative, technical and physical measures designed to protect the integrity of our customers' data and prevent data loss, misappropriation and other security incidents.

We engage third-party vendors and service providers to store and otherwise process some of our and our customers' data, including sensitive and personal information. There have been and may continue to be significant supply chain attacks generally, and our third-party vendors and service providers may be targeted or affected by such attacks and other efforts to exploit cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Our ability to monitor our third-party vendors and service providers' data security is limited. Threat actors may be able to circumvent those security measures and gain unauthorized access to, or cause misuse, disclosure, loss, destruction or other unauthorized processing of, our and our customers' data, including sensitive and personal information. Further, threat actors may attempt to deploy malicious code to users of the open source libraries leveraged by our products, which could negatively affect us and those users.

Techniques used to sabotage or obtain unauthorized access to systems or networks are constantly evolving and, in some instances, are not identified until launched against a target. We and our third-party vendors and service providers may be unable to anticipate these techniques, react to them in a timely manner, or implement adequate preventative measures. Because of the complexity and interconnectedness of our systems and networks and those on which we rely, the process of upgrading or patching our protective measures could itself create a risk of cybersecurity issues or system disruptions, including for customers who rely upon, or have exposure to, such systems and networks.

Limitations of liability provisions in our customer and user agreements, contracts with third-party vendors and service providers or other contracts may not be enforceable or adequate to protect us from any liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim relating to a security incident. We are subject to risks that our existing insurance coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms or available in sufficient amounts to cover claims related to a cybersecurity incident, or that the insurer may deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or coinsurance requirements, could adversely affect our business.

## Table of Contents

## Our ability to grow our business may suffer if we are unable to expand adoption of our Elastic Cloud offerings.

We believe our future success will depend significantly on the growth in the adoption of Elastic Cloud, our family of cloud-based offerings. We have incurred and will continue to incur substantial costs to develop, sell and support our Elastic Cloud offerings. We have also entered into non-cancelable multiyear cloud hosting capacity commitments with certain third-party cloud providers, which require us to pay for such capacity irrespective of actual usage. We believe that we must offer a family of cloud-based products to address the market segment that prefers a cloud-based solution to a self-managed solution and that there will be increasing demand for cloud-based offerings of our products. For the years ended April 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022, Elastic Cloud contributed 43%, 40%, and 35% of our total revenue, respectively. However, as the use of cloud-based computing solutions is rapidly evolving, it is difficult to predict the potential growth, if any, of general market adoption, customer adoption, and retention rates of our cloud-based offerings. There could be decreased demand for our cloud-based offerings due to reasons within or outside of our control, including, among other factors, lack of customer acceptance, technological challenges with bringing cloud offerings to market and maintaining those offerings, information security, data protection, or privacy concerns, our inability to properly manage and support our cloud-based offerings, competing technologies and products, weakening economic conditions, and decreases in corporate spending. If we are not able to develop, market, or deliver cloud-based offerings that satisfy customer requirements technically or commercially, if our investments in cloud-based offerings do not yield the expected return, or if we are unable to decrease the cost of providing our cloud-based offerings, our business, competitive position, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed.

## Our operating results are likely to fluctuate from quarter to quarter, and our financial results in any one quarter should not be relied upon as indicative of future performance.

Our results of operations, including our revenue, cost of revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, cash flow and deferred revenue, have fluctuated from quarter-to-quarter in the past and may continue to vary significantly in the future so that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful. These variations may be further impacted as more of our Elastic Cloud customers adopt consumption-based arrangements or as Elastic Cloud customers already on consumption-based arrangements optimize their usage in response to the current macroeconomic environment. Accordingly, our financial results in any one quarter should not be relied upon as indicative of future performance. Our quarterly financial results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, may be difficult to predict, and may or may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business. Factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly financial results include the risks and uncertainties described in this 'Risk Factors' section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The impact of one or more of these factors may cause our operating results to vary significantly. Such fluctuations in our results could cause us to fail to meet the expectations of investors or securities analysts, which could cause the trading price of our ordinary shares to fall substantially, and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits, which could have an adverse effect on our business.

## Seasonality may cause fluctuations in our sales and results of operations.

Historically, we have experienced quarterly fluctuations and seasonality in our sales and results of operations based on the timing of our entry into agreements with new and existing customers, customer usage patterns for our consumption-based arrangements, and the mix between annual and monthly contracts entered into each reporting period. Trends in our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows are impacted by seasonality in our sales cycle, which generally reflects a trend toward the highest sales in our fourth fiscal quarter and the lowest sales in our first fiscal quarter. We expect that this seasonality will continue to affect our results of operations in the future, and might become more pronounced as we continue to target larger enterprise customers.

## If our existing customers do not renew their subscriptions, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.

We derive a significant portion of our revenue from renewals of existing subscriptions. Our customers have no contractual obligation to renew their subscriptions after the completion of their subscription term. Our subscriptions for self-managed deployments typically range from one to three years, while many of our Elastic Cloud customers purchase subscriptions either on a month-to-month basis or on a committed contract of generally one to three years in duration.

Our customers may decline to renew their contracts as a result of a number of factors, including their budgets, their satisfaction with our products and our customer support, our products' ability to integrate with new and changing technologies, the frequency and severity of product outages, our product uptime or latency, and the pricing of our products or competing products. If our customers renew their subscriptions, they may renew for shorter subscription terms or on other terms that are less economically beneficial to us. If our existing customers do not renew their subscriptions, or renew on less favorable terms, our revenue may grow more slowly than expected or decline.

## Table of Contents

## If we are unable to increase sales of our subscriptions to new customers, sell additional subscriptions to our existing customers, or expand the value of our existing customers' subscriptions, our revenue growth rate may decline.

We offer certain features of our products with no payment required. Customers purchase subscriptions in order to gain access to additional functionality and support. Our future success depends on our ability to sell our subscriptions to new customers, including to large enterprises, and to expand the deployment of our offerings with existing customers by selling paid subscriptions to our existing users and expanding the value and number of existing customers' subscriptions. Our ability to sell new subscriptions depends on a number of factors, including the prices of our offerings, the prices of products offered by our competitors, and the budgets of our customers. We also face difficulty in displacing the products of incumbent competitors. In addition, a significant aspect of our sales and marketing focus is to expand deployments within existing customers. The rate at which our existing customers purchase additional subscriptions and expand the value of existing subscriptions depends on a number of factors, including customers' level of satisfaction with our offerings, the nature and size of the deployments, the desire to address additional use cases, the perceived need for additional features, and general economic conditions. If our existing customers do not purchase additional subscriptions or expand the value of their subscriptions, our Net Expansion Rate may decline. We rely in large part on our customers to identify new use cases for our products in order to expand such deployments and grow our business. If our customers do not recognize the potential of our offerings, our business would be materially and adversely affected. If our efforts to sell subscriptions to new customers and to expand deployments at existing customers are not successful, our total revenue and revenue growth rate may decline, and our business could suffer.

## We do not have an adequate history with our consumption-based arrangements for our Elastic Cloud offerings to predict accurately the long-term rate of customer adoption or renewal, or the impact those arrangements will have on our near-term or long-term revenue or operating results.

Because we recognize revenue under a consumption-based arrangement based on actual customer consumption, we do not have the same ability to predict the timing of revenue recognition as we do under subscription arrangements where revenue is recognized on a predetermined schedule over the subscription term. Moreover, customers may consume our products at a different pace than we expect. For example, we have experienced and, if adverse economic conditions persist, may continue to experience slowing consumption as customers look to optimize their usage. Additionally, we have seen and may continue to see newer customers increase their consumption of our solutions at a slower pace than our more tenured customers. For these reasons, our revenue may be less predictable or more variable than our historical revenue, and our actual results may differ materially from our forecasts.

## If we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand, especially among developers and executives with budgetary control, our ability to expand our customer base will be impaired and our business and operating results may be adversely affected.

We believe that developing and maintaining widespread awareness of our brand, especially with developers and executives with budgetary control, is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our software and attracting new users and customers. We also believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition in our market increases. Successfully maintaining and enhancing our brand will depend largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts, our ability to maintain our customers' trust, our ability to continue to develop new functionality and use cases, and our ability to successfully differentiate our products and platform capability from competitive products. Brand promotion activities may not generate user or customer awareness or increase revenue. Even if they do, any increase in revenue may not offset the expenses we incur in building our brand. For instance, our continued focus and investment in our ElasticON user conferences and similar investments in our brand, user engagement, and customer engagement may not generate the desired customer awareness or a sufficient financial return. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand, we may fail to attract or retain users and customers necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand-building efforts, or to achieve the widespread brand awareness that is critical for broad customer adoption of our products, which would adversely affect our business and results of operations.

## We may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors.

The market for our products is highly competitive, quickly evolving, fragmented, and subject to rapid changes in technology, shifting customer needs, and frequent introductions of new offerings. We believe that our ability to compete depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control.

## Table of Contents

Some of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources, stronger brand recognition, broader global distribution and presence, more established relationships with current or potential customers and partners, and larger customer bases than we do. These factors may allow our competitors to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer preferences. These competitors may engage in more extensive research and development efforts, undertake more far-reaching and successful sales and marketing campaigns, have more experienced sales professionals, execute more successfully on their go-to-market strategy and have greater access to more markets and decision makers, and adopt more aggressive pricing policies which may allow them to build larger customer bases than we have. New start-up companies that innovate and large competitors that are making significant investments in research and development may develop similar offerings that compete with our offerings or that achieve greater market acceptance than our offerings. This could attract customers away from our offerings and reduce our market share. As market segments become increasingly crowded and competition intensifies, we could potentially face increasing costs of goods and services sold. If we are unable to anticipate or react effectively to these competitive challenges, our competitive position would weaken, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.

## If we are not able to keep pace with technological and competitive developments, our performance may be negatively affected.

The market for search technologies, including search, observability and security, is subject to rapid technological change, innovation (such as the use of AI), evolving industry standards, and changing regulations, as well as changing customer needs, requirements and preferences. Our success depends upon our ability to continue to innovate, enhance existing products, expand the use cases of our products, anticipate and respond to changing customer needs, requirements, and preferences, and develop and introduce in a timely manner new offerings that keep pace with technological and competitive developments.

We have experienced delays in releasing new products, deployment options, and product enhancements and may experience similar delays in the future. As a result, in the past, some of our customers deferred purchasing our products until the next upgrade was released. Future delays or problems in the installation or implementation of our new releases may cause customers to forgo purchases of our products and purchase products of our competitors instead.

The success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful product development, market acceptance, our ability to manage the risks associated with new product releases, the availability of software components for new products, the effective management of development and other spending in connection with anticipated demand for new products, the availability of newly developed products, and the risk that new products may have bugs, errors, or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction. We have experienced bugs, errors, or other defects or deficiencies in new products and product updates and may have similar experiences in the future. Furthermore, our ability to increase the usage of our products depends, in part, on the development of new use cases for our products, which is typically driven by our developer community and may be outside of our control. We also have invested, and may continue to invest, in the acquisition of complementary businesses, technologies, services, products and other assets that expand the products that we can offer our customers. We may make these investments without being certain that they will result in products or enhancements that will be accepted by existing or prospective customers. If we are unable to successfully enhance our existing products to meet evolving customer requirements, increase adoption and usage of our products, develop new products, or if our efforts to increase the usage of our products are more expensive than we expect, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected.

## Sales of our products could suffer if the markets for those products do not grow or if we fail to adapt and respond effectively to evolving markets.

The markets for certain of our products, such as our Search, Observability and Security solutions, are evolving and our products are relatively new in these markets. Accordingly, it is difficult to predict continued customer adoption and renewals for these products, customers' demand for these products, the size, growth rate, expansion, and longevity of these markets, the entry of competitive products, or the success of existing competitive products. Our ability to penetrate these evolving markets depends on a number of factors, including the cost, performance, and perceived value associated with our products. If these markets do not continue to grow as expected or if we are unable to anticipate or react to changes in these markets, our competitive position could weaken, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.

## Table of Contents

## The length of our sales cycle can be unpredictable, particularly with respect to sales through our channel partners or sales to large customers, and our sales efforts may require considerable time and expense, which could negatively affect our cash flows and results of operations.

Our results of operations may fluctuate, in part, because of the length and variability of the sales cycle of our subscriptions and the difficulty in making short-term adjustments to our operating expenses. Our results of operations depend in part on sales to new customers, including large customers, and increasing sales to existing customers. The length of our sales cycle, from initial contact with our sales team to contractually committing to our subscriptions, can vary substantially from customer to customer based on deal complexity as well as whether a sale is made directly by us or through a channel partner. Our sales cycle can extend to more than a year for some customers, and the length of sales cycles may be further impacted due to worsening economic conditions. In addition, some customers have been scrutinizing their spending more carefully and reducing their consumption spending given the current uncertain economic environment, and we generally expect this caution to continue. We have also experienced and, if adverse economic conditions persist, may continue to experience longer and more unpredictable sales cycles. As we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, we may face greater costs, longer sales cycles, greater competition and less predictability in completing some of our sales. A customer's decision to use our solutions may be an enterprise-wide decision, which may require greater levels of education regarding the use cases of our products or protracted negotiations. In addition, larger customers may demand more configuration, integration services and features. It is difficult to predict exactly when, or even if, we will make a sale to a potential customer or if we can increase sales to our existing customers. As a result, large individual sales in some cases have occurred in quarters subsequent to those we expected, or have not occurred at all. Lengthened or unpredictable sales cycles that cause a loss or delay of one or more large transactions in a quarter could affect our cash flows and results of operations for that quarter and for future quarters. These impacts are amplified in the short term when customers slow their consumption in response to the uncertain macroeconomic environment. Because a substantial proportion of our expenses are relatively fixed in the short term, our cash flows and results of operations could suffer if revenue falls below our expectations in a particular quarter.

## Because we recognize the vast majority of the revenue from subscriptions, either based on actual consumption or ratably over the term of the relevant subscription period, downturns or upturns in sales are not immediately reflected in full in our results of operations.

Subscription revenue accounts for the substantial majority of our revenue, constituting 93%, 92%, and 93% of total revenue for the years ended April 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The effect of significant downturns in new or renewed sales of our subscriptions is not reflected in full in our results of operations until future periods. We recognize the vast majority of our subscription revenue either based on actual consumption or ratably over the term of the relevant time period. As a result, much of the subscription revenue we report each fiscal quarter represents the recognition of deferred revenue from subscription contracts entered into during previous fiscal quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one fiscal quarter will not be fully or immediately reflected in revenue in that fiscal quarter and will negatively affect our revenue in future fiscal quarters.

## The sales prices of our offerings may decrease, which may reduce our revenue and gross profits and adversely affect our financial results.

The sales prices for our offerings may decline or we may introduce new pricing models for a variety of reasons, including competitive pricing pressures, discounts, in anticipation of or in conjunction with the introduction of new offerings, or promotional programs. Competition continues to increase in the market segments in which we operate, and we expect competition to continue to increase, thereby leading to increased pricing pressures. Larger competitors with more diverse offerings may reduce the price of offerings that compete with ours or may bundle them with other offerings. Additionally, currency fluctuations in some countries and regions and pressures from uncertain inflation and interest rate environments may negatively impact actual prices that customers and channel partners are willing to pay in those countries and regions. Any decrease in the sales prices for our offerings may reduce our revenue and gross profit, unless accompanied by an increase in volume to offset the effects of such price decreases, or in the case of gross profit, unless accompanied by a corresponding decrease of sufficient magnitude in costs. Gross profit could also be adversely impacted by a shift in the mix of our subscriptions from selfmanaged to our cloud offering, for which we incur hosting costs, as well as any increase in our mix of services relative to subscriptions. We may not be able to maintain our prices and gross profits at levels that will allow us to achieve and maintain profitability.

## Table of Contents

## We expect our revenue mix to vary over time, which could harm our gross margin and operating results.

We expect our revenue mix to vary over time as a result of a number of factors, any one of which or the cumulative effect of which may result in significant fluctuations in our gross margin and operating results. We expect that revenue from Elastic Cloud, which contributed 43%, 40%, and 35% of our total revenue in fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, will continue to become a larger part of our revenue mix. Due to the differing revenue recognition policies applicable to our subscriptions and services, shifts in our business mix from quarter to quarter could produce substantial variation in revenue recognized. The variation in our revenue also may result from the growth of consumption-based arrangements for our Elastic Cloud offerings, where the revenue we recognize is tied to our customers' actual usage of our products, and further reduction in usage by customers already using a consumption-based arrangement due to the uncertain macroeconomic environment. Further, our gross margins and operating results could be harmed by changes in revenue mix and costs, together with numerous other factors, including our entry into new markets or growth in lower margin markets; our entry into markets with different pricing and cost structures; pricing discounts; and increased price competition.

## We depend on our senior management and other key employees, and the loss of one or more of these employees or an inability to attract and retain highly skilled employees could harm our business.

Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel. The loss of the services of any of our key personnel, the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel, or delays in hiring required personnel, particularly in engineering and sales, may seriously harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, our ability to attract additional qualified personnel may be impacted by the economic uncertainty and insecurity caused by macroeconomic factors and geopolitical events. The loss of services of any of our key personnel also increases our dependency on other key personnel who remain with us. Although we have entered into employment offer letters with our key personnel, their employment is for no specific duration and constitutes at-will employment. We are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing engineering personnel because of the complexity of our products.

Our future performance also depends on the continued service and continuing contributions of our senior management, particularly our Chief Executive Officer, Ashutosh Kulkarni, and Chief Technology Officer, co-founder and former Chief Executive Officer, Shay Banon, to execute on our business plan and to identify and pursue new opportunities and product innovations. We do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees. The loss of services of senior management could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our development and strategic objectives, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Any search for senior management in the future or any search to replace the loss of any senior management may be protracted, and we may not be able to attract a qualified candidate or replacement, as applicable, in a timely manner or at all, particularly as potential candidates may be less willing to change jobs during the unstable economic conditions caused by macroeconomic and geopolitical events.

The industry in which we operate is generally characterized by significant competition for skilled personnel as well as high employee attrition. The increased availability of hybrid or remote working arrangements within our industry has further expanded the pool of companies that can compete for our employees and employment candidates. We may not be successful in attracting, integrating, or retaining qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs. We may need to invest significant amounts of cash and equity to attract and retain new employees, and we may never realize returns on these investments. Also, to the extent we hire personnel from competitors, we may be subject to allegations that they have been improperly solicited, that they have divulged proprietary or other confidential information, or that their former employers own their inventions or other work product.

## If we do not effectively develop and expand our sales and marketing capabilities, including expanding, training, and compensating our sales force, we may be unable to add new customers, increase sales to existing customers or expand the value of our existing customers' subscriptions.

We dedicate significant resources to sales and marketing initiatives, which require us to invest significant financial and other resources, including in markets in which we have limited or no experience. Our business and results of operations will be harmed if our sales and marketing efforts do not generate significant revenue increases or increases that are smaller than anticipated.

## Table of Contents

We may not achieve revenue growth from expanding our sales force if we are unable to hire, train, and retain talented and effective sales personnel. We depend on our sales force to obtain new customers and to drive additional sales to existing customers. We believe that there is significant competition for sales personnel, including sales representatives, sales managers, and sales engineers, with the requisite skills and technical knowledge. Our ability to achieve significant revenue growth will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training and retaining sufficient sales personnel to support our growth, and as we introduce new products, solutions, and marketing strategies, we may need to re-train existing sales personnel. New hires also require extensive training, which may take significant time before they achieve full productivity. Our recent hires and planned hires may not become productive as quickly as we expect, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the markets where we do business or plan to do business. As we continue to grow rapidly, a large percentage of our sales force will have relatively little experience working with us, our subscriptions, and our business model. Additionally, we may need to evolve our sales compensation plans to drive the growth of our Elastic Cloud offerings with consumption-based arrangements. Such changes may have adverse consequences if they are not designed effectively. If we are unable to hire and train sufficient numbers of effective sales personnel, our new and existing sales personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time, our sales personnel are not successful in obtaining new customers or increasing sales to our existing customer base, or our sales and marketing programs, including our sales compensation plans, are not effective, our growth and results of operations could be negatively impacted.

## Our failure to offer high-quality customer support could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

After our products are deployed within our customers' IT environments, our customers depend on our technical support services to resolve issues relating to our products. If we do not succeed in helping our customers quickly resolve post-deployment issues or provide effective ongoing support and education on our products, our ability to renew or sell additional subscriptions to existing customers or expand the value of existing customers' subscriptions would be adversely affected and our reputation with potential customers could be damaged. Many larger enterprise and government entity customers have more complex IT environments and require higher levels of support than smaller customers. If we fail to meet the requirements of these enterprise customers, it may be more difficult to increase sales with them.

Additionally, it can take several months to recruit, hire, and train qualified technical support employees. We may not be able to hire such employees fast enough to keep up with demand, particularly if the sales of our offerings exceed our internal forecasts. Due to the uncertainty related to macroeconomic conditions, there may also be more competition for qualified employees and delays in hiring, onboarding, and training new employees. To the extent that we are unsuccessful in hiring, training, and retaining adequate support resources, our ability to provide adequate and timely support to our customers, and our customers' satisfaction with our offerings, will be adversely affected. Our failure to provide and maintain, or a market perception that we do not provide or maintain, high-quality support services would have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

## Our corporate culture has contributed to our success, and if we cannot maintain this culture as we grow, we could lose the innovation, creativity and entrepreneurial spirit we have worked to foster, which could harm our business.

We believe that our culture has been and will continue to be a key contributor to our success. We expect to continue to hire as we expand. If we do not continue to maintain our corporate culture as we grow, we may be unable to foster the innovation, creativity, and entrepreneurial spirit we believe we need to support our growth. Moreover, many of our existing employees may be able to receive significant proceeds from sales of our ordinary shares in the public markets, which could lead to employee attrition and disparities of wealth among our employees that might adversely affect relations among employees and our culture in general. Additional headcount growth and employee turnover may result in a change to our corporate culture, which could harm our business.

## We may not be able to realize the benefits of our marketing strategies to offer some of our product features free of charge and to provide free trials of some of our paid features.

We are dependent upon lead generation strategies, including offering free use of some of our product features and free trials of some of our paid features. These strategies may not be successful in continuing to generate sufficient sales opportunities necessary to increase our revenue. Many users never convert from the free use model or from free trials to the paid versions of our products. To the extent that users do not become, or we are unable to successfully attract, paying customers, we will not realize the intended benefits of these marketing strategies and our ability to grow our revenue will be adversely affected.

## Our international operations and expansion expose us to a variety of risks.

As of April 30, 2024, we had customers located in over 125 countries, and our strategy is to continue to expand internationally. In addition, as of April 30, 2024, as a result of our strategy of leveraging a distributed workforce, we had employees located in over 35 countries. Our current international operations involve and future initiatives may involve a variety of risks, including:

- political and economic instability related to international disputes, such as the evolving conflict in Israel and Gaza and Russia's war with Ukraine and the related impact on macroeconomic conditions as a result of such conflicts, which may negatively impact our customers, partners, and vendors;
- unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, taxes, trade laws, tariffs, export quotas, custom duties or other trade restrictions;
- different labor regulations, especially in the European Union, where labor laws are generally more advantageous to employees than in the United States, including deemed hourly wage and overtime regulations in these locations;
- exposure to many stringent regulations relating to privacy, data protection and information security, particularly in the European Union, and potentially inconsistent laws and regulations in these areas across countries;
- changes in a specific country's or region's political or economic conditions;
- the evolving relations between the United States and China;
- changes in relations between the Netherlands and the United States;
- risks resulting from changes in currency exchange rates and inflationary pressures;
- risks resulting from the migration of invoicing from local billing entities to centralized regional billing entities;
- the impact of public health epidemics or pandemics on our employees, partners, and customers;
- challenges inherent in efficiently managing an increased number of employees over large geographic distances, including the need to implement appropriate systems, policies, benefits and compliance programs;
- risks relating to enforcement of U.S. export control laws and regulations including the Export Administration Regulations ('EAR'), trade and economic sanctions, including restrictions promulgated by the Office of Foreign Assets Control ('OFAC'), and other similar trade protection regulations and measures in the United States or in other jurisdictions;
- risks relating to our third-party vendors and service providers' storage and processing of some of our and our customers' data, including any supply chain cybersecurity attacks;
- reduced ability to timely collect amounts owed to us by our customers in countries where our recourse may be more limited;
- limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations derived from one country to fund the capital needs of our operations in other countries;
- political, economic and trade uncertainties or instability related to the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union (Brexit);
- limited or unfavorable intellectual property protection; and
- exposure to liabilities under anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended ('FCPA'), and similar applicable laws and regulations in other jurisdictions.

If we are unable to address these difficulties and challenges or other problems encountered in connection with our international operations and expansion, we might incur unanticipated liabilities or we might otherwise suffer harm to our business generally.

## Table of Contents

## If we are not successful in sustaining and expanding our international business, we may incur additional losses and our revenue growth could be harmed.

Our future results depend, in part, on our ability to sustain and expand our penetration of the international markets in which we currently operate and to expand into additional international markets. We depend on direct sales and our channel partner relationships to sell our offerings in international markets. Our ability to expand internationally will depend upon our ability to deliver functionality and foreign language translations that reflect the needs of the international clients that we target. Our ability to expand internationally involves various risks, including the need to invest significant resources in such expansion, and the possibility that returns on such investments will not be achieved in the near future or at all in these less familiar competitive environments. We may also choose to conduct our international business through other partnerships. If we are unable to identify partners or negotiate favorable terms, our international growth may be limited. In addition, we have incurred and may continue to incur significant expenses before we generate material revenue as we attempt to establish our presence in particular international markets.

## We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.

A portion of our subscription revenue is generated, and a portion of our operating expenses is incurred, outside the United States in foreign currencies. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar versus foreign currencies, particularly with respect to the Euro and the British Pound Sterling, may impact our operating results when translated into U.S. dollars. Exchange rates have been volatile as a result of geopolitical conflicts and uncertain macroeconomic conditions, and this volatility may continue. A strengthening of the U.S. dollar could adversely affect year-over-year growth and increase the real cost of our offerings to our non-U.S. dollar customers, leading to delays in the purchase of our offerings and the lengthening of our sales cycle. If, as has occurred in recent periods, the strength of the U.S. dollar increases, our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected. In addition, increased international sales in the future, including through our channel partners, may result in greater foreign currency-denominated sales, increasing our foreign currency risk. Moreover, operating expenses incurred outside the United States in foreign currencies are increasing and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. If we are not able to successfully hedge against the risks associated with currency fluctuations, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.

## Any need by us to raise additional capital or generate the significant capital necessary to expand our operations and invest in new offerings could limit our ability to compete and could harm our business.

We may need to raise additional funds in the future, and we may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, if at all, particularly during times of market volatility, changes in the interest rate environment, and general economic instability. If we raise additional equity financing, our shareholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the per share value of our ordinary shares could decline. Furthermore, if we engage in debt financing, the holders of debt would have priority over the holders of our ordinary shares, and we may be required to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness. We may also be required to take other actions that would otherwise be in the interests of the debt holders and force us to maintain specified liquidity or other ratios, any of which could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. If we need additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms, we may not be able, among other actions, to:

- develop or enhance our products;
- continue to expand our sales and marketing and research and development organizations;
- acquire complementary technologies, products or businesses;
- expand operations in the United States or internationally;
- hire, train, and retain employees; or
- respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated working capital requirements.

Our failure to have sufficient capital to do any of these things could limit our ability to compete and harm our business.

## Table of Contents

## Our generation of a portion of our revenue by sales to government entities subjects us to a number of risks.

We generate an increasing portion of our revenue from sales to U.S. and non-U.S. government entities. Sales to government entities are subject to a number of risks. Selling to government entities can be highly competitive, expensive, and time-consuming, often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that these efforts will generate a sale. Government certification and security requirements for products like ours may change, thereby restricting our ability to sell into the U.S. federal government sector, U.S. state or local government sector, or government sectors of countries other than the United States until we have obtained the revised certification or met the changed security requirements. If we are unable to timely meet such requirements, our ability to compete for and retain federal government contracts may be diminished, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Government entities may have statutory, contractual, or other legal rights to terminate contracts with us or our channel partners for convenience or due to a default, and any such termination may adversely affect our future results. Government demand and payment for our offerings may be affected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations, with funding reductions or delays adversely affecting public sector demand for our offerings or exercise of options under multi-year contracts. Contracts with government agencies, including classified contracts, are subject to extensive, evolving and sometimes complex regulations, as well as audits and reviews of contractors' administrative processes and other contract related compliance obligations. Breaches of government contracts, failure to comply with applicable regulations or unfavorable findings from government audits or reviews could result in contract terminations, reputational harm or other adverse consequences, including but not limited to ineligibility to sell to government agencies in the future, government refusal to continue buying our subscriptions, a reduction of revenue, or fines or civil or criminal liability, which could adversely affect our results of operations in a material way.

## If we are unable to maintain successful relationships with our partners, or if our partners fail to perform or we are unable to maintain successful relationships with them, our business operations, financial results, and growth prospects could be adversely affected.

We maintain partnership relationships with a variety of partners, including cloud providers such as Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, systems integrators, channel partners, referral partners, OEM and MSP partners, and technology partners, to deliver offerings to our end customers and complement our broad community of users. In particular, we partner with various cloud providers to jointly market, sell and deliver our Elastic Cloud offerings, which in some instances also involves technical integration with such cloud providers. Our ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will depend in part on our success in maintaining successful relationships with our partners and in helping our partners enhance their ability to market and sell our subscriptions. If we are unable to maintain our relationships with these partners, our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be harmed.

Our agreements with our partners are generally non-exclusive, so that our partners may offer customers the offerings of several different companies, including offerings that compete with ours, or may themselves be or become competitors. Some of these partners may also market, sell, and support offerings that compete with ours, may devote more resources to the marketing, sales, and support of such competitive offerings, may have incentives to promote our competitors' offerings to the detriment of our own or may cease selling our offerings altogether. If our partners do not effectively market and sell our offerings, choose to use greater efforts to market and sell their own offerings or those of our competitors, fail to provide adequate technical integration with their own offerings, fail to meet the needs of our customers, fail to deliver services to our customers, or if we lose one or more of our channel partners, our ability to expand our business and sell our offerings may be harmed. Our partners may cease marketing our offerings with limited or no notice and with little or no penalty. The loss of a substantial number of our partners, our possible inability to replace them, or the failure to recruit additional partners could harm our performance.

In addition, many of our new channel partners require extensive training and may take several months or more to become effective in marketing our offerings. Our channel partner sales structure could subject us to lawsuits, potential liability, misstatement of revenue, and reputational harm, if, for example, any of our channel partners misrepresents the functionality of our offerings to customers or violates laws or our or their corporate policies, including our terms of business, which in turn could impact reported revenue, deferred revenue, and remaining performance obligations.

While the vast majority of downloads of Elasticsearch and Kibana from mid-2018 through early 2021 were licensed under the Elastic License, the removal of the Apache 2.0 alternative could negatively impact certain developers for whom the availability of an open source license was important. In addition, some developers and the companies for whom they work may be hesitant to download or upgrade to new versions of Elasticsearch or Kibana under the Elastic License or SSPL because of uncertainty regarding how these licenses may be interpreted and enforced. Other developers, including competitors of Elastic such as Amazon, have announced that they have 'forked' Elasticsearch and Kibana, which means they have developed their own product or service that is based on features of Elasticsearch and Kibana that we had previously made available under an open source license. For example, Amazon has launched an open source project called OpenSearch based on a forked version of the Elastic Stack, which is licensed under Apache 2.0, and rebranded their existing Elasticsearch Service as OpenSearch Service. The combination of uncertainty regarding our dual license model and the potential competition from the forked versions of our software may negatively impact adoption of Elasticsearch and Kibana, which in turn could lead to reduced brand and product awareness and to a decline in paying customers, which could harm our ability to grow our business or achieve profitability.

## We could be negatively impacted if the Elastic License or SSPL, under which some of our software is licensed, is not enforceable.

We make the source code of our products available under Apache 2.0, the Elastic License, or as dual licensed under the Elastic License and SSPL, depending on the product and version. Apache 2.0 is a permissive open source license that allows licensees to freely copy, modify and distribute Apache 2.0licensed software if they meet certain conditions. The Elastic License is our proprietary source available license. The Elastic License permits licensees to use, copy, modify and distribute the licensed software so long as they do not offer access to the software as a cloud service, interfere with the license key or remove proprietary notices. SSPL is a source-available license that is based on the GNU Affero General Public License ('AGPL') open source license and permits licensees to copy, modify and distribute SSPL-licensed software, but expressly requires licensees that offer the SSPL-licensed software as a third-party service to open source all of the software that they use to offer such service. We rely upon the enforceability of the restrictions set forth in the Elastic License and SSPL to protect our proprietary interests. If a court were to hold that the Elastic License or SSPL or certain aspects of these licenses are unenforceable, others may be able to use our software to compete with us in the marketplace in a manner not subject to the restrictions set forth in the Elastic License or SSPL.

## If third parties offer inadequate or defective implementations of software that we have previously made available under an open source license, we could experience lost sales and lack of market acceptance of our products.

Certain cloud hosting providers and managed service providers, including AWS, offer hosted products or services based on a forked version of the Elastic Stack, which means they offer a service that includes some of the features that we had previously made available under an open source license. These offerings are not supported by us and come without any of our proprietary features, whether free or paid. We do not control how these third parties may use or offer our open source technology. These third parties could inadequately or incorrectly implement our open source technology or fail to update such technology in light of changing technological or security requirements, which could result in real or perceived defects, security vulnerabilities, errors, or performance failures with respect to their offerings. Users, customers, and potential customers could confuse these third-party products with our products, and attribute such defects, security vulnerabilities, errors, or performance failures to our products. Any damage to our reputation and brand from defective implementations of our open source software could result in lost sales and lack of market acceptance of our products and could adversely affect our business and growth prospects.

## Table of Contents

## Limited technological barriers to entry into the markets in which we compete may facilitate entry by other enterprises into our markets to compete with us.

Anyone may obtain access to source code for the features of our software that we have licensed under open source or source available licenses. Depending on the product and version of the Elastic software, this source code is available under Apache 2.0, SSPL, or the Elastic License. Each of these licenses allows anyone, subject to compliance with the conditions of the applicable license, to redistribute our software in modified or unmodified form and use it to compete in our markets. Such competition can develop without the degree of overhead and lead time required by traditional proprietary software companies, due to the rights granted to licensees of open source and source available software. It is possible for competitors to develop their own software, including software based on our products, potentially reducing the demand for our products and putting pricing pressure on our subscriptions. For example, Amazon offers some of the features that we had previously made available under an open source license as part of its AWS offering. As such, Amazon competes with us for potential customers, and while Amazon cannot provide our proprietary software, Amazon's offerings may reduce the demand for our offerings and the pricing of Amazon's offerings may limit our ability to adjust the prices of our products. Competitive pressure in our markets generally may result in price reductions, reduced operating margins and loss of market share.

## A real or perceived defect, security vulnerability, error, or performance failure in our software could cause us to lose revenue, damage our reputation, and expose us to liability.

Our products are inherently complex and, despite extensive testing and quality control, have in the past and may in the future contain defects or errors, especially when first introduced, or otherwise not perform as contemplated. These defects, security vulnerabilities, errors or performance failures could cause damage to our reputation, loss of customers or revenue, product returns, order cancelations, service terminations, or lack of market acceptance of our software. As the use of our products, including products that were recently acquired or developed, expands to more sensitive, secure, or mission-critical uses by our customers, we may be subject to increased scrutiny, potential reputational risk, or potential liability if our software should fail to perform as contemplated in such deployments. We have issued in the past, and may need to issue in the future, corrective releases of our software to fix these defects, errors or performance failures, which could require us to allocate significant research and development and customer support resources to address these problems.

Any limitation of liability provisions that may be contained in our customer and partner agreements may not be effective as a result of existing or future applicable law or unfavorable judicial decisions. The sale and support of our products entail the risk of liability claims, which could be substantial in light of the use of our products in enterprise-wide environments. Our insurance against this liability may not be adequate to cover a potential claim.

## Interruptions or performance problems associated with our technology and infrastructure, and our reliance on technologies from third parties, may adversely affect our business operations and financial results.

We rely on third-party cloud platforms to host our cloud offerings. If we experience an interruption in service for any reason, our cloud offerings would similarly be interrupted. The ongoing effects of geopolitical conflicts, adverse economic conditions, and increased energy prices could also disrupt the supply chain of hardware needed to maintain our third-party data center operations. An interruption in our services to our customers, particularly as we increasingly attract more large customers than in the past, could cause our customers' internal and consumer-facing applications to cease functioning, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, customer relationships and reputation.

In addition, our website and internal technology infrastructure may experience performance issues due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, website or third-party hosting disruptions, capacity constraints, technical failures, natural disasters or fraud or security attacks. Our use of third-party open source software may increase this risk. If our website is unavailable or our users are unable to download our products or order subscriptions or services within a reasonable amount of time or at all, our business could be harmed. We expect to continue to make significant investments to maintain and improve website performance and to enable rapid releases of new features and applications for our products. To the extent that we do not effectively upgrade our systems as needed and continually develop our technology to accommodate actual and anticipated changes in technology, our business and results of operations may be harmed.

## Table of Contents

## Incorrect implementation or use of our software, or our customers' failure to update our software, could result in customer dissatisfaction and negatively affect our reputation and growth prospects.

Our products are often operated in large scale, complex IT environments. Our customers and some partners require training and experience in the proper use of, and the benefits that can be derived from, our products to maximize their potential value. If our products are not implemented, configured, updated, or used correctly or as intended, or in a timely manner, inadequate performance, errors, loss of data, corruptions, and/or security vulnerabilities may result. For example, there have been, and may in the future continue to be, reports that some of our customers have not properly secured implementations of our products, which can result in unprotected data. Because our customers rely on our software to manage a wide range of operations, the incorrect implementation or use of our software, our customers' failure to update our software, or our failure to train customers on how to use our software productively, may result in customer dissatisfaction or negative publicity and may adversely affect our reputation and brand. Failure by us to provide adequate training and implementation services to our customers could result in lost opportunities for follow-on sales to these customers and decrease subscriptions by new customers, and adversely affect our business and growth prospects.

## If our website fails to rank prominently in unpaid search results, traffic to our website could decline and revenue could be adversely affected.

Our success depends in part on our ability to attract users through unpaid Internet search results on traditional web search engines, such as Google. The number of users we attract to our website from search engines is due in large part to how and where our website ranks in unpaid search results. These rankings can be affected by a number of factors, many of which are not in our direct control, and they may change frequently. For example, a search engine may change its ranking algorithms, methodologies or design layouts. As a result, links to our website may not be prominent enough to drive traffic to our website, and we may not know how or otherwise be in a position to influence the results. Any reduction in the number of users directed to our website could reduce our revenue or require us to increase our customer acquisition expenditures.

## Our business operations and sales performance could be disrupted if we fail to maintain satisfactory relationships with third-party service providers on which we rely for many aspects of our business.

Our success depends upon our relationships with third-party service providers, including providers of cloud hosting infrastructure, customer relationship management systems, financial reporting systems, human resource management systems, credit card processing platforms, marketing automation systems, and payroll processing systems, among others. If any of these third parties experience difficulty meeting our requirements or standards, become unavailable due to extended outages or interruptions, temporarily or permanently cease operations, face financial distress or other business disruptions such as a security incident, or increase their fees, if our relationships with any of these providers deteriorate, or if any of the agreements we have entered into with such third parties are terminated or not renewed without adequate transition arrangements, we could suffer liabilities, penalties, fines, increased costs and delays in our ability to provide customers with our products and services, our ability to manage our finances could be interrupted, receipt of payments from customers may be delayed, our processes for managing sales of our offerings could be impaired, our ability to generate and manage sales leads could be weakened, or our business operations could be disrupted. Further, our business operations may be disrupted by negative impacts of the evolving conflict in Israel and Gaza and Russia's war with Ukraine on supply chains of our third-party service providers. Any such disruptions may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows until we replace such providers or develop replacement technology or operations. In addition, our business may suffer if we are unsuccessful in identifying high-quality service providers, negotiating cost-effective relationships with them or effectively managing these relationships.

## Failure to establish, maintain and protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights could substantially harm our business and results of operations.

Our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to establish, maintain and protect our proprietary technology, methodologies, know-how and brand. We rely on a combination of trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets, contractual restrictions, and other intellectual property laws and confidentiality procedures to establish and protect our proprietary rights. The steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may be inadequate.

## Table of Contents

We will not be able to protect our intellectual property rights if we are unable to enforce our rights or if we do not detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights. The source code of proprietary features for some versions of the Elastic Stack offered under certain licenses is publicly available, which may enable others to replicate our proprietary technology and compete more effectively with us. If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors may gain access to our proprietary technology and our business may be harmed. In addition, defending our intellectual property rights might entail significant expense and resource allocation. Any patents, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights that we have or may obtain may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. Patent applications we file may not result in issued patents. Even if we continue to seek patent protection in the future, we may be unable to obtain further patent protection for certain aspects of our technology. In addition, any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages, or may be successfully challenged by third parties. Furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability, and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain and will vary by jurisdiction.

Despite our precautions, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our products and use information that we regard as proprietary to create offerings that compete with ours. Effective patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our products are available. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names, social media names, or trademarks that are similar to, infringe upon, or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights. The laws of some countries are not as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the United States, and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate to achieve our objectives. As we expand our international activities, our exposure to unauthorized copying and use of our products and proprietary information will likely increase.

We enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and enter into confidentiality agreements with other parties. These agreements may not be effective in controlling access to and distribution of our proprietary information. Further, these agreements may not prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our products. Our ability to enforce such agreements could be adversely affected if a rule adopted by the Federal Trade Commission ('FTC') in April 2024 withstands legal challenge. If the FTC rule takes effect, it would deem unlawful existing non-compete agreements entered into with workers who are not 'senior executives,' and would ban us from entering into new non-compete agreements with any worker, including senior executives. The FTC states that whether a given prohibition constitutes a noncompete agreement is a fact-specific inquiry so that a confidentiality undertaking, if sufficiently broad, might be seen by the FTC as a prohibited non-compete agreement.

To protect our intellectual property rights, we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. Litigation has previously been, and may in the future be, necessary to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights. Even if we prevail in such disputes, we may not be able to recover all or a portion of any judgments, and litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming, and distracting to management. If unsuccessful, litigation could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Further, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims, and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Our inability to protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized copying or use, as well as any costly litigation or diversion of our management's attention and resources, could delay further sales or the implementation of our products, impair the functionality of our products, delay introductions of new products, result in our being required to substitute inferior or more costly technologies into our products or incur warranty and indemnifications costs with our customers, or injure our reputation.

## We could incur substantial costs as a result of any claim of infringement, misappropriation or violation of another party's intellectual property rights.

In recent years, there has been significant litigation involving patents and other intellectual property rights in the software industry. Companies providing software are increasingly bringing and becoming subject to suits alleging infringement, misappropriation or violation of proprietary rights, particularly patent rights, and to the extent we gain greater market visibility, we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement, misappropriation or violation claims. The risk of patent litigation has been amplified by the increase in the number of a type of patent holder, which we refer to as a non-practicing entity, whose sole or principal business is to assert such claims and against whom our own intellectual property portfolio may provide little deterrent value. We could incur substantial costs in prosecuting or defending any intellectual property litigation. While we do not provide large language models, our products and solutions may contain integrations of third party large language models, which may indirectly expose us to copyright infringement or other intellectual property misappropriation claims depending on the datasets and training models used by such third parties in their AI and generative AI offerings. If we sue to enforce our rights or are sued by a third party that claims that our products infringe, misappropriate or violate its rights, the litigation could be expensive and could divert our management resources from operations.

## Table of Contents

Any intellectual property litigation to which we might become a party, or for which we are required to provide indemnification, may require us to do one or more of the following:

- cease selling or using products that incorporate the intellectual property rights that we allegedly infringe, misappropriate or violate;
- make substantial payments for legal fees, settlement payments or other costs or damages;
- obtain a license, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, to sell or use the relevant technology; or
- redesign the allegedly infringing products to avoid infringement, misappropriation or violation, which could be costly, time-consuming or impossible.

If we are required to make substantial payments or undertake any of the other actions noted above as a result of any intellectual property infringement, misappropriation or violation claims against us or any obligation to indemnify our customers for such claims, such payments or actions could harm our business.

## Indemnity provisions in various agreements potentially expose us to substantial liability for intellectual property infringement, misappropriation, violation and other losses.

Our agreements with customers and other third parties may include indemnification provisions under which we agree to indemnify them for losses suffered or incurred as a result of claims of intellectual property infringement, misappropriation or violation, damages caused by us to property or persons, or other liabilities relating to or arising from our software, services or other contractual obligations. Large indemnity payments could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. Although we normally contractually limit our liability with respect to such indemnity obligations, we may still incur substantial liability related to them. Any dispute with a customer with respect to such obligations could have adverse effects on our relationship with that customer and other existing customers and new customers and harm our business and results of operations.

## Our use of third-party open source software within our products could negatively affect our ability to sell our products and subject us to litigation.

Our technologies strategically incorporate open source software from other developers, and we expect to continue to incorporate such open source software in our products in the future. Few of the licenses applicable to open source software have been interpreted by courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products. Moreover, we may not have incorporated third-party open source software in our software in a manner that is consistent with the terms of the applicable license or our current policies and procedures. If we fail to comply with these licenses, we may be subject to certain requirements, including requirements that we offer our solutions that incorporate the open source software for no cost, that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon incorporating or using the open source software, and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of applicable open source licenses. Additionally, some open source software may include output from generative AI software or other software that incorporates or relies on generative AI or other AI technologies. The use of such open source software may expose us to risks as the intellectual property ownership and license rights, including copyright, of generative AI software and tools have not been fully interpreted by U.S. courts or been fully addressed by federal or state regulation or those of other international legal jurisdictions in which we do business. Attempting to ensure compliance of integrating such open source and generative AI components with licensing terms, regulatory changes, and our required intellectual property guidelines and legal requirements to do business may result in the expenditure of significant resources and in our failure to meet all relevant, material software release timetables and requirements. Moreover, changes in supply chain and export control regulations imposed by the United States and other governments due to geopolitical changes and government policies may require us to make changes to certain of our open source and other third-party dependencies, which may result in additional costs and may adversely impact customer use and adoption of our solutions.

## Table of Contents

If an author or other third party that distributes such open source software were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses, we could incur significant legal expenses defending against such allegations and could be subject to significant damages, enjoined from the sale of our products that contained the open source software and required to comply with onerous conditions or restrictions on these products, which could disrupt the distribution and sale of these products. In addition, there have been claims challenging the ownership rights in open source software against companies that incorporate open source software into their products, and the licensors of such open source software provide no warranties or indemnities with respect to such claims. In any of these events, we and our customers could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products, and to re-engineer our products or discontinue the sale of our products in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis. We and our customers may also be subject to suits by parties claiming infringement, misappropriation or violation due to the reliance by our solutions on certain open source software, and such litigation could be costly for us to defend or subject us to an injunction. Some open source projects have known vulnerabilities and architectural instabilities and are provided on an 'as-is' basis which, if not properly addressed, could negatively affect the performance of our product. Any of the foregoing could require us to devote additional research and development resources to re-engineer our solutions, could result in customer dissatisfaction, and may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

## Risks Related to Taxation

## Unanticipated changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could expose us to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.

Our income tax obligations are based in part on our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements, including the manner in which we develop, value, and use our intellectual property and the valuations of our intercompany transactions. The tax laws applicable to our business, including the laws of the Netherlands, the United States and other jurisdictions, are subject to change and interpretation. Any new legislation or interpretations of existing legislation could impact our tax obligations in countries where we do business or cause us to change the way we operate our business and result in increased taxation of our international earnings.

For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD')/G20 Inclusive Framework has been working on addressing the tax challenges arising from the digitalization of the economy, including by releasing the OECD's Pillar One and Pillar Two blueprints on October 12, 2020. Pillar One refers to the re-allocation of taxing rights to jurisdictions where sustained and significant business is conducted, regardless of a physical presence, while Pillar Two establishes a minimum tax to be paid by multinational enterprises. On December 15, 2022, the Council of the EU formally adopted Directive (EU) 2022/2523 (the 'Pillar Two Directive') to achieve a coordinated implementation of Pillar Two in EU Member States consistent with EU law. In the Netherlands, this directive has been implemented in the Minimum Tax Rate Act 2024 ( Wet minimumbelasting 2024 ). This measure will ensure that multinational enterprises that are within the scope of the Pillar Two rules will be subject to a corporate tax rate of at least 15%. We do not currently believe that the Minimum Tax Rate Act 2024 will have a material adverse effect on our financial results.

In 2022, the United States enacted legislation implementing several changes to U.S. tax laws, including a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax on applicable corporations with an average adjusted financial statement income (AFSI) in excess of $1 billion for any three consecutive years preceding the tax year at issue. In addition, on January 1, 2022, a provision of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 went into effect that eliminates the option to deduct domestic research and development costs in the year incurred and instead requires taxpayers to amortize such costs over five years. These provisions do not materially affect our cash flows or deferred tax assets.

The United States has enacted legislation imposing a new minimum tax called the Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax (the 'BEAT') on certain U.S. corporations. The BEAT is imposed on certain deductible amounts paid by a U.S. corporation that (i) has aggregate gross receipts of at least $1.5 billion over its three prior taxable years and (ii) is at least 25%-owned by a non-U.S. person (or otherwise related to a non-U.S. person in specified circumstances). The BEAT taxes 'modified taxable income' of a U.S. corporation described above at a rate which increased to 10% in 2019 and will increase further to 12.5% in 2026. In general, modified taxable income is calculated by adding back to the U.S. corporation's regular taxable income the amount of certain 'base erosion tax benefits' with respect to payments to foreign affiliates, as well as the 'base erosion percentage' of any net operating loss deductions. The BEAT applies only to the extent it exceeds the U.S. corporation's regular corporate income tax liability (determined without regard to certain tax credits).

## Table of Contents

The applicability of sales, use and other indirect tax laws or regulations on our business is uncertain. Adverse tax laws or regulations could be enacted or existing laws could be applied to us or our customers, which could subject us to additional tax liability and related interest and penalties, increase the costs of our services and adversely impact our business.

The application of U.S. federal, state, local, and non-U.S. tax laws to services provided electronically is evolving. New sales, use, value-added, goods and services, consumption or other direct or indirect tax laws could be enacted at any time (possibly with retroactive effect), and could be applied solely or disproportionately to services provided over the Internet, directly or through partners, or could otherwise materially affect our financial position and operating results. As we expand the scale of our international business activities, any changes in the U.S. or non-U.S. taxation of such activities may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.

In addition, tax jurisdictions have differing rules and regulations governing sales, use, value-added, goods and services, consumption and other taxes, and these rules and regulations can be complex and are subject to varying interpretations that may change over time. Existing tax laws could be interpreted, changed, modified, or applied adversely to us (possibly with retroactive effect), which could require us or our customers to pay additional tax amounts on prior sales and going forward, as well as require us or our customers to pay fines or penalties and interest for past amounts. Although our customer contracts typically provide that our customers must pay all applicable sales and similar taxes, our customers may be reluctant to pay back taxes and associated interest or penalties, or we may determine that it would not be commercially feasible to seek reimbursement. If we are required to collect and pay back taxes and associated interest and penalties, or we are unsuccessful in collecting such amounts from our customers, we could incur potentially substantial unplanned expenses, thereby adversely impacting our operating results and cash flows. Imposition of such taxes on our services going forward could also adversely affect our sales activity and have an adverse impact on our operating results and cash flows.

## Our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements are subject to the tax laws of various jurisdictions under which we could be obligated to pay additional taxes.

Based on our current corporate structure, we may be subject to taxation in several jurisdictions around the world with increasingly complex tax laws, the application of which can be uncertain. The amount of taxes we pay in these jurisdictions could increase substantially as a result of changes in the applicable tax principles, including increased tax rates, new tax laws or revised interpretations of existing tax laws and precedents. The taxing authorities of some of such jurisdictions may challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements, which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations. Tax authorities examine and may audit our income tax returns and other non-income tax returns, such as payroll, sales, value-added, net worth or franchise, property, goods and services, and excise taxes, in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions. It is possible that tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken, and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our financial position and results of operations. Further, the determination of our worldwide provision for, or benefit from, income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management, and there are transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.

## Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.

As of April 30, 2024, we had net operating loss carryforwards ('NOL') for Netherlands, United States (federal and state, respectively) and United Kingdom income tax purposes of $1.237 billion, $806.9 million, $641.7 million and $78.2 million, respectively, which may be utilized against future income taxes. Limitations imposed by the applicable jurisdictions on our ability to utilize NOLs could cause income taxes to be paid earlier than would be paid if such limitations were not in effect and could cause such NOLs to expire unused, in each case reducing or eliminating the benefit of such NOLs. Furthermore, we may not be able to generate sufficient taxable income to utilize affected NOLs before they expire. If any of these events occur, we may not derive some or all of the expected benefits from our NOLs.

## Table of Contents

## U.S. persons who hold our ordinary shares may suffer adverse tax consequences if we are characterized as a passive foreign investment company.

A non-U.S. corporation will generally be considered a passive foreign investment company ('PFIC'), for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in any taxable year if either (i) at least 75% of its gross income for such year is passive income or (ii) at least 50% of the value of its assets (based on an average of the quarterly values of the assets during such year) is attributable to assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income ('the PFIC asset test'). For purposes of the PFIC asset test, the value of our assets will generally be determined by reference to our market capitalization. Based on our past and current projections of our income and assets, we do not expect to be a PFIC for the current taxable year or for the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, a separate factual determination as to whether we are or have become a PFIC must be made each year (after the close of such year). Since our projections may differ from our actual business results and our market capitalization and value of our assets may fluctuate, we cannot assure you that we will not be or become a PFIC in the current taxable year or any future taxable year. If we are a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. person (as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended) holds our ordinary shares, such U.S. person may be subject to adverse tax consequences. Each U.S. person who holds our ordinary shares is strongly urged to consult his, her or its tax advisor regarding the application of these rules and the availability of any potential elections.

## If a U.S. person is treated as owning at least 10% of our ordinary shares, such U.S. person may be subject to adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences.

If a U.S. person is treated as owning (directly, indirectly, or constructively) at least 10% of the total combined voting power of our shares, or of the total value of our shares, such shareholder may be treated as a 'United States shareholder' with respect to each 'controlled foreign corporation' in our group (if any). Because our group includes one or more U.S. subsidiaries, certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries could be treated as controlled foreign corporations (regardless of whether we are treated as a controlled foreign corporation). A United States shareholder of a controlled foreign corporation may be required to report annually and include in its U.S. taxable income its pro rata share of 'Subpart F income,' 'global intangible low-taxed income,' and investments in U.S. property by controlled foreign corporations, regardless of whether we make any distributions. An individual that is a United States shareholder with respect to a controlled foreign corporation generally would not be allowed certain tax deductions or foreign tax credits that would be allowed to a United States shareholder that is a U.S. corporation. We cannot provide any assurances that we will assist investors in determining whether we or any of our non-U.S. subsidiaries is treated as a controlled foreign corporation or whether any investor is treated as a United States shareholder with respect to any such controlled foreign corporation or furnish to any investor who may be a United States shareholder information that may be necessary to comply with the reporting and tax paying obligations referred to above. Failure to comply with these reporting obligations may subject a shareholder who is a United States shareholder to significant monetary penalties and may prevent from starting the statute of limitations with respect to such shareholder's U.S. federal income tax return for the year for which reporting was due. A U.S. person should consult its advisors regarding the potential application of these rules to an investment in our ordinary shares.

## We may not be able to make distributions or repurchase shares without subjecting our shareholders to Dutch withholding tax.

We have not paid a dividend on our ordinary shares in the past and we do not intend to pay any dividends to holders of our ordinary shares in the foreseeable future. See 'Risks Related to Ownership of our Ordinary Shares - We do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future, so your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our ordinary shares.' However, if we ever do pay dividends or repurchase shares, then under current Dutch tax law, the dividend paid or repurchase price paid may be subject to Dutch dividend withholding tax at a rate of 15% under the Dutch Dividend Withholding Tax Act ( Wet op de dividendbelasting 1965 , 'Regular Dividend Withholding Tax'), unless a domestic or treaty exemption applies.

In addition, dividends paid to related entities in designated low-tax jurisdictions may be subject to an alternative withholding tax ('Alternative Withholding Tax') at the highest Dutch corporate income tax rate in effect at the time of the distribution (currently 25.8%). An entity is considered related if (i) it has a 'Qualifying Interest' in our company, (ii) our company has a 'Qualifying Interest' in the entity holding the ordinary shares, or (iii) a third party has a "Qualifying Interest" in both our company and the entity holding the ordinary shares. The term 'Qualifying Interest' means a direct or indirectly held interest either by an entity individually or jointly if an entity is part of a collaborating group ( samenwerkende groep ) that enables such entity or such collaborating group to exercise a definite influence over another entity's decisions, such as our company or an entity holding ordinary shares, as the case may be, and allows it to determine the other entity's activities. The Alternative Withholding Tax will be reduced, but not below zero, with any Regular Dividend Withholding Tax imposed on distributions. Based on currently applicable rates, the overall effective rate of withholding of Regular Dividend Withholding Tax and Alternative Withholding Tax will not exceed the highest corporate income tax rate in effect at the time of the distribution (currently 25.8%).

If we cease to be a Dutch tax resident for the purposes of a tax treaty concluded by the Netherlands and in certain other events, we could potentially be subject to a proposed Dutch dividend withholding tax in respect of a deemed distribution of our entire market value less paid-up capital.

Under a proposal of law currently pending before the Dutch Parliament, the Emergency act conditional exit dividend withholding tax ( Spoedwet conditionele eindafrekening dividendbelasting , 'DWT Exit Tax'), we will be deemed to have distributed an amount equal to our entire market capitalization less recognized paid-up capital immediately before the occurrence of certain events, including if we cease to be a Dutch tax resident for purposes of a tax treaty concluded by the Netherlands with another jurisdiction and become, for purposes of such tax treaty, exclusively a tax resident of that other jurisdiction which is a qualifying jurisdiction. A qualifying jurisdiction is a jurisdiction other than a member state of the EU/EEA which does not impose a withholding tax on distributions, or that does impose such tax but that grants a step-up for earnings attributable to the period before we become exclusively a resident in such jurisdiction. This deemed distribution will be subject to a 15% tax insofar as it exceeds a franchise of EUR 50 million. The tax will be payable by us as a withholding agent. A full exemption applies to entities and individuals that are resident in an EU/EEA member state or a state that has concluded a tax treaty with the Netherlands that contains a dividend article, provided we submit a declaration confirming the satisfaction of applicable conditions by qualifying shareholders within one month following the taxable event. We will be deemed to have withheld the tax on the deemed distribution and have a statutory right to recover this from our shareholders. Dutch resident shareholders qualifying for the exemption are entitled to a credit or refund, and non-Dutch resident shareholders qualifying for the exemption are entitled to a refund, subject to applicable statutory limitations, provided the tax has been actually recovered from them.

The DWT Exit Tax proposal has been amended several times since the initial proposal and is under ongoing discussion. In addition, a critical reaction from authorities to the latest proposal of law have been published. It is therefore not certain whether the DWT Exit Tax will be enacted and if so, in what form. If enacted in its present form, the DWT Exit Tax will have retroactive effect as from December 8, 2021.

## Risks Related to Regulatory Matters

## Any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with government or other obligations related to privacy, data protection and information security could adversely affect our business.

We are subject to compliance risks and uncertainties under a variety of federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing privacy, data protection, information security, and the collection, storage, transfer, use, retention, sharing, disclosure, protection, and processing of personal data. Privacy, data protection, and information security laws may be interpreted and applied differently depending on the jurisdiction and continue to evolve, making it difficult to predict how they may develop and apply to us.

The regulatory frameworks for these issues worldwide are rapidly evolving and are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. Federal, state, or non-U.S. government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted, and may in the future adopt, new laws and regulations or may make amendments to existing laws and regulations affecting data protection, data privacy and/or information security and/or regulating the use of the Internet as a commercial medium.

In the United States, many states have enacted such legislation. These laws and regulations may include a private right of action for certain data breaches or noncompliance with privacy or security obligations, may provide for penalties and other remedies, and may require us to incur substantial costs and expenses and liabilities in connection with our compliance. Other U.S. states and the U.S. federal government are considering or have enacted similar privacy legislation or regulations. Many obligations under these laws and legislative or regulatory proposals remain uncertain, and we cannot fully predict their impact on our business. Failure to comply with these varying laws and standards may subject us to investigations, enforcement actions, civil litigation, fines and other penalties, all of which may generate negative publicity and have a negative impact on our business.

Internationally, most jurisdictions in which we operate have established their own privacy, data protection and information security legal frameworks with which we or our customers must comply. Within the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation ('GDPR') applies to the processing of personal data. The GDPR imposes significant obligations upon our business, and compliance with these obligations can vary depending on how different regulators may interpret them. Failure to comply, or perceived failure to comply, can result in administrative fines of up to 20 million Euros or four percent of the group's annual global turnover, whichever is higher. Similarly, the United Kingdom has implemented legislation that is substantially similar to the GDPR where penalties for violations, actual or perceived, can be up to 17.5 million British Pound Sterling or four percent of the group's annual global turnover, whichever is higher, which may be subject to change with the introduction of the Data Protection and Digital Information ('DPDI') Bill in 2023. The potential impact to our business remains unclear.

On May 22, 2023, Ireland's Data Protection Commission ('DPC') found that a company's use of standard contractual clauses ('SCC') in its data transfers failed to adequately protect the personal data of its European users, and fined that company approximately $1.3 billion. While the full implications of this DPC decision for other companies such as us are not yet clear, those implications may, among other matters, affect our ability to continue using SCCs in our contracts or subject us to increased risk of regulatory fines related to our use of SCCs. Furthermore, in July 2023, the European Commission adopted its adequacy decision on data transfers under the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework ('DPF'). The adequacy decision provides a new lawful basis for transAtlantic data transfers from data exporters in the EU to U.S. data importers who certify compliance with the DPF principles. The DPF is currently being challenged, including by a member of the French Parliament. In light of these and other ongoing developments relating to cross-border data transfer, we may experience additional costs associated with increased compliance burdens, and this regulation may impact our ability to transfer personal data across our organization, to customers, or to third parties.

In addition to government regulation, industry groups have established or may establish new and different self-regulatory standards that may legally or contractually apply to us or our customers. One example of such a self-regulatory standard is the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, known as PCI DSS, which relates to the processing of payment card information. Moreover, our customers increasingly expect us to comply with more stringent privacy, data protection, and information security requirements than those imposed by laws, regulations, or self-regulatory requirements, and we may be obligated contractually to comply with additional or different standards relating to our handling or protection of data on or by our offerings. Any failure to meet our customers' requirements may adversely affect our revenues and prospects for growth.

## Table of Contents

We also expect that there will continue to be changes in interpretations of existing or new laws and regulations, proposed laws, and other obligations, which could impair our or our customers' ability to process personal data, decrease demand for our offerings, impact our marketing efforts, increase our costs, and impair our ability to maintain and grow our customer base and increase our revenue. It is possible that these laws and regulations or other actual or asserted obligations relating to privacy, data protection, or information security may be interpreted and applied in manners that are, or are alleged to be, inconsistent with our data management practices or the features of our products. In such an event, we could face fines, lawsuits, regulatory investigations, and other claims and penalties, and we could be required to fundamentally change our products or our business practices, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business.

Data protection authorities and other regulatory bodies are increasingly focused on the use of online tracking tools and have issued or plan to issue rulings which may impact our marketing practices. Any restrictions on using online analytics and tracking tools could lead to substantial costs, require significant changes to our policies and practices, limit the effectiveness of our marketing activities, divert the attention of our technology personnel, adversely affect our margins, and subject us to additional liabilities.

We publicly post privacy statements and other documentation regarding our practices concerning the processing, use and disclosure of personal data. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with such statements could result in potential actions by regulatory bodies or government entities if they are found to be unfair or misrepresentative of our actual practices or inconsistent with legal requirements for such statements resulting in increased costs, changes in our business practices, or reputational harm.

## We are subject to governmental export and import controls and economic sanctions programs that could impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to liability if we violate these controls.

Our software and services, in some cases, are subject to U.S. export control laws and regulations including the EAR, and trade and economic sanctions maintained by OFAC as well as similar laws and regulations in the countries in which we do business. An export license may be required to export or re-export our software and services to, or import our software and services into, certain countries and to certain end-users or for certain end-uses. If we were to fail to comply with such U.S. and foreign export control laws and regulations, trade and economic sanctions, or other similar laws, we could be subject to both civil and criminal penalties, including substantial fines, possible incarceration for employees and managers for willful violations, and the possible loss of our export or import privileges. Obtaining the necessary export license for a particular sale or offering may not be possible and may be time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. Furthermore, export control laws and economic sanctions in many cases prohibit the export of software and services to certain embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments and persons, as well as for prohibited end-uses. Monitoring and ensuring compliance with these complex U.S. export control laws involves uncertainties because our offerings are widely distributed throughout the world, and information available on the users of these offerings is, in some cases, limited. Even though we take precautions in an effort to ensure that we and our partners comply with all relevant export control laws and regulations, any failure by us or our partners to comply with such laws and regulations could have negative consequences for us, including reputational harm, government investigations and penalties.

Various countries have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products and services or could limit our end customers' ability to implement our products in those countries based on encryption in our offerings. Changes in our products or changes in export and import regulations in such countries may create delays in the introduction of our products and services into international markets, prevent our end customers with international operations from deploying our products globally or, in some cases, prevent or delay the export or import of our products and services to certain countries, governments or persons altogether. Reduced use of our products and services by, or decreased ability by us to export or sell our products to, existing or potential end customers with international operations could result from changes in export or import laws or regulations, economic sanctions or related legislation; shifts in the enforcement or scope of existing export, import or sanctions laws or regulations; or changes in the countries, governments, persons, or technologies targeted by such export, import or sanctions laws or regulations.

## Table of Contents

## Failure to comply with anti-bribery, anti-corruption, and anti-money laundering laws could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.

We are required to comply with the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-bribery, anti-corruption, and anti-money laundering laws in various U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions. We are subject to compliance risks as a result of our use of channel partners to sell our offerings abroad and our use of other third parties, including recruiting firms, professional employer organizations, legal, accounting and other professional advisors, and local vendors to meet our needs in international markets. We and these third parties may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies, or state-owned or affiliated entities, and we may be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of our channel partners and third-party representatives, as well as our employees, representatives, contractors, partners, and agents, even if we do not authorize such activities. While we have policies and procedures to address compliance with such laws, our channel partners, third-party representatives, employees, contractors or agents may take actions in violation of our policies and applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. Any violation of the FCPA, U.K. Bribery Act or other applicable anti-bribery, anti-corruption laws, and anti-money laundering laws could result in whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil sanctions, or suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracts, all of which may have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, operating results and prospects.

## Risks Related to Ownership of our Ordinary Shares

## The market price for our ordinary shares has been and is likely to continue to be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance.

The stock markets, and securities of technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. Stock prices of many technology companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In particular, stock prices of companies with significant operating losses have recently declined significantly, and in many instances more significantly than stock prices of companies with operating profits. The economic impact and uncertainty of changes in the inflation, interest and macroeconomic environments, and geopolitical conflicts exacerbated this volatility in both the overall stock markets and the market price of our ordinary shares. A significant decline in the price of our shares could have an adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention. In the past, shareholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, our involvement could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our operations and adversely affect our business. The market price of our ordinary shares may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including those resulting from the risks and uncertainties described in this 'Risk Factors' section.

## We may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business and future operating results, which would cause our stock price to decline.

We have provided and may continue to provide guidance and other expectations regarding our future performance in our quarterly and annual earnings conference calls, quarterly and annual earnings releases, or other public disclosures. Guidance, as well as other expectations, are forward-looking and represent our management's estimates as of the date of release and are based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, while presented with numerical specificity, are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies on our business, many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions, some of which will change. Furthermore, analysts and investors may develop and publish their own forecasts concerning our financial results, which may form a consensus about our future performance. Our actual business results may vary significantly from such guidance or other expectations or that consensus due to a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including due to the global economic uncertainty and financial market conditions caused by the current macroeconomic environment, and which could adversely affect our business and future operating results. Furthermore, if we make downward revisions of our previously announced guidance or other expectations, if we withdraw our previously announced guidance or other expectations, or if our publicly announced guidance or other expectations of future operating results fail to meet expectations of securities analysts, investors or other interested parties, the price of our ordinary shares could decline. In light of the foregoing, investors should not unduly rely upon our guidance or other expectations in making an investment decision regarding our ordinary shares.

## The concentration of our share ownership with insiders will likely limit your ability to influence corporate matters, including the ability to influence the outcome of director elections and other matters requiring shareholder approval.

Our executive officers and directors together beneficially own a significant amount of our outstanding ordinary shares. As a result, these shareholders, acting together, will have significant influence over matters that require approval by our shareholders, including matters such as adoption of the financial statements, declarations of dividends, the appointment and dismissal of directors, capital increases, amendment to our articles of association and approval of significant corporate transactions. Corporate action might be taken even if other shareholders oppose them. This concentration of ownership might also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us that other shareholders may view as beneficial.

## The issuance of additional ordinary shares in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, our equity incentive plans or otherwise will dilute all other shareholders.

Our articles of association authorize us to issue up to 165 million ordinary shares and up to 165 million preference shares with such rights and preferences as are included in our articles of association. On October 5, 2023, our general meeting of shareholders (the '2023 General Meeting') empowered our board of directors to issue ordinary shares up to 20% of our issued share capital as of August 21, 2023, for a period of 18 months from October 5, 2023 (the '2023 share issuance authorization'). In line with market practice for Dutch publicly traded companies, we expect to renew this authorization annually at our general meeting of shareholders. Subject to compliance with applicable rules and regulations and the above authorization limitation, we may issue ordinary shares or securities convertible into ordinary shares from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, investment, our equity incentive plans or otherwise. Any such issuance could result in

## Table of Contents

substantial dilution to our existing shareholders unless pre-emptive rights exist and cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline.

## Certain holders of our ordinary shares may not be able to exercise pre-emptive rights and as a result may experience substantial dilution upon future issuances of ordinary shares.

Holders of our ordinary shares in principle have a pro rata pre-emptive right with respect to any issue of ordinary shares or the granting of rights to subscribe for ordinary shares, unless Dutch law or our articles of association state otherwise or unless explicitly provided otherwise in a resolution by our general meeting of shareholders ('general meeting'), or if authorized by the annual general meeting or an extraordinary general meeting, by a resolution of our board of directors. Our 2023 general meeting has empowered our board of directors to limit or exclude pre-emptive rights on ordinary shares issued pursuant to the 2023 share issuance authorization, up to 10% of our issued share capital as of August 21, 2023 for a period of 18 months from October 5, 2023, which could cause existing shareholders to experience substantial dilution of their interest in us. In line with market practice for Dutch publicly traded companies, we expect to renew this authorization annually at our general meeting.

As of April 30, 2024, there were no preference shares issued or outstanding. Preference shares in the capital of the Company may currently be issued pursuant to a resolution adopted by the general meeting of shareholders at the proposal of the board of directors. Pre-emptive rights do not exist with respect to the issue of preference shares and holders of preference shares, if any, have no pre-emptive right to acquire newly issued ordinary shares. Also, pre-emptive rights do not exist with respect to the issue of shares or grant of rights to subscribe for shares to our employees or contributions in kind.

## Sales of substantial amounts of our ordinary shares in the public markets, or the perception that they might occur, could reduce the price that our ordinary shares might otherwise attain.

Sales of a substantial number of shares of our ordinary shares in the public market, particularly sales by our directors, executive officers and significant shareholders, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our ordinary shares and may make it more difficult for you to sell your ordinary shares at a time and price that you deem appropriate.

We have also filed, and will file in the future, registration statements on Form S-8 under the Securities Act registering all ordinary shares that we may issue under our equity compensation plans, which may in turn be sold in the public market and may adversely affect the market price for our ordinary shares.

## Certain anti-takeover provisions in our articles of association and under Dutch law may prevent or could make an acquisition of our company more difficult, limit attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove members of our board of directors and may adversely affect the market price of our ordinary shares.

Our articles of association contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company. These provisions could also make it difficult for shareholders to appoint directors that are not nominated by the current members of our board of directors or take other corporate actions, including effecting changes in our management. These provisions include:

- the staggered three-year terms of the members of our board of directors, as a result of which only approximately one-third of the members of our board of directors may be subject to election in any one year;
- a provision that the members of our board of directors may only be removed by a general meeting by a two-thirds majority of votes cast representing at least 50% of our issued share capital if such removal is not proposed by our board of directors;
- a provision that the members of our board of directors may only be appointed upon binding nomination of the board of directors, which can only be overruled with a two-thirds majority of votes cast representing at least 50% of our issued share capital;
- requirements that certain matters, including an amendment of our articles of association, may only be brought to our shareholders for a vote upon a proposal by our board of directors; and
- minimum shareholding thresholds, based on nominal value, for shareholders to call general meetings of our shareholders or to add items to the agenda for those meetings.

## Table of Contents

## We are subject to the Dutch Corporate Governance Code but do not comply with all the suggested governance provisions of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, which may affect your rights as a shareholder.

As a Dutch company, we are subject to the Dutch Corporate Governance Code ('DCGC'). The DCGC contains both principles and suggested governance provisions for management boards, supervisory boards, shareholders and general meetings, financial reporting, auditors, disclosure, compliance and enforcement standards. The DCGC is based on a 'comply or explain' principle. Accordingly, public companies are required to disclose in their annual reports, filed in the Netherlands, whether they comply with the suggested governance provisions of the DCGC. If they do not comply with those provisions, such as because of a conflicting requirement, companies are required to give the reasons for such noncompliance. The DCGC applies to all Dutch companies listed on a government-recognized stock exchange, whether in the Netherlands or elsewhere, including the NYSE. The principles and suggested governance provisions apply to our board of directors (in relation to role and composition, conflicts of interest and independence requirements, board committees and remuneration), shareholders and the general meeting (for example, regarding anti-takeover protection and our obligations to provide information to our shareholders) and financial reporting (such as external auditor and internal audit requirements). We aim to comply with all applicable provisions of the DCGC except where such provisions conflict with U.S. exchange listing requirements or with market practices in the United States or the Netherlands. This compliance position may affect your rights as a shareholder, and you may not have the same level of protection as a shareholder in a Dutch company that fully complies with the suggested governance provisions of the DCGC.

## We do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future, so your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our ordinary shares.

We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our shares. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings for use in the operation of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our ordinary shares in the foreseeable future. Were this position to change, payment of future dividends may be made only if our equity exceeds the amount of the paid-in and called-up part of the issued share capital, increased by the reserves required to be maintained by Dutch law or by our articles of association. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their ordinary shares after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments.

## Claims of U.S. civil liabilities may not be enforceable against us.

We are incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands and substantial portions of our assets are located outside of the United States. In addition, two members of our board of directors reside outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon us or such other persons residing outside the United States, or to enforce outside the United States judgments obtained against such persons in U.S. courts in any action, including actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws. In addition, it may be difficult for investors to enforce, in original actions brought in courts in jurisdictions located outside the United States, rights predicated upon the U.S. federal securities laws.

There is no treaty between the United States and the Netherlands for the mutual recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon the U.S. federal securities laws, would not be enforceable in the Netherlands unless the underlying claim is re-litigated before a Dutch court of competent jurisdiction. In such proceedings, however, a Dutch court may be expected to recognize the binding effect of a judgment of a federal or state court in the United States without re-examination of the substantive matters adjudicated thereby, if (i) the jurisdiction of the U.S. federal or state court has been based on internationally accepted principles of private international law, (ii) the judgment resulted from legal proceedings compatible with Dutch notions of due process, (iii) the judgment does not contravene public policy of the Netherlands and (iv) the judgment is not incompatible with (x) an earlier judgment of a Dutch court between the same parties, or (y) an earlier judgment of a foreign court between the same parties in a dispute regarding the same subject and based on the same cause, if that earlier foreign judgment is recognizable in the Netherlands.

Based on the foregoing, U.S. investors may not be able to enforce against us or members of our board of directors, officers or certain experts named in our filings with the SEC, who are residents of the Netherlands or countries other than the United States, any judgments obtained in U.S. courts in civil and commercial matters, including judgments under the U.S. federal securities laws.

In addition, there can be no assurance that a Dutch court would impose civil liability on us, the members of our board of directors, our officers or certain experts named in our filings with the SEC in an original action predicated solely upon the U.S. federal securities laws brought in a court of competent jurisdiction in the Netherlands against us or such members, officers or experts.

## Table of Contents

## If industry or financial analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue inaccurate or unfavorable research regarding our ordinary shares, our share price and trading volume could decline, which could adversely affect our business.

The trading market for our ordinary shares is influenced by the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. We do not control these analysts, or the content and opinions included in their reports. If any of the analysts who cover us issues an inaccurate or unfavorable opinion regarding our company, our stock price would likely decline. Furthermore, investors and analysts may not understand how our consumption-based arrangements differ from a typical subscription-based pricing model. In addition, the stock prices of many companies in the technology industry have declined significantly after those companies have failed to meet, or significantly exceed, the financial guidance publicly announced by the companies or the expectations of analysts or public investors. If our financial results fail to meet, or significantly exceed, our announced guidance or the expectations of analysts or public investors, our stock price may decline. Analysts also could downgrade our ordinary shares or publish unfavorable research about us. If one or more of the analysts who cover our company ceases to cover us, or fails to publish reports on us regularly, our profile in the financial markets could decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline and could adversely affect our business.

## If our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect, our results of operations could fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the trading price of our ordinary shares.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as described in 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our results of operations may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our results of operations to fall below our publicly announced guidance or the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the market price of our ordinary shares. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition, deferred contract acquisition costs, acquired intangible assets, and income taxes.

## Risks Related to our Outstanding Senior Notes

## We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could adversely affect our financial condition.

We have a substantial amount of indebtedness and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future. As of April 30, 2024, we had $575.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.125% Senior Notes due July 15, 2029 (the 'Senior Notes') outstanding. Our indebtedness could have important consequences, including:

- limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements;
- requiring a portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes, thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;
- increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions; and
- increasing our cost of borrowing.

In addition, the indenture that governs the Senior Notes contains restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interest. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of substantially all of our indebtedness.

## We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.

Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and results of operations, which in turn are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

## Table of Contents

If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on, among other factors, the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments and the indenture that governs the Senior Notes may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In the absence of such cash flows and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. Any of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Further, any future credit facility or other debt instrument may contain provisions that will restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from any such disposition. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations and any such failure to meet our scheduled debt service obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

## The indenture that governs the Senior Notes contains, and any of our future debt instruments may contain, terms which restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions.

The indenture that governs the Senior Notes contains a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interest, including, among other things, restrictions on our ability to:

- create liens on certain assets to secure debt;
- grant a subsidiary guarantee of certain debt without also providing a guarantee of the Senior Notes; and
- consolidate or merge with or into, or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets to, another person.

The covenants in the indenture that governs the Senior Notes are subject to important exceptions and qualifications described in such indenture.

As a result of these restrictions, we are limited as to how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. The terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants and may require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests. We may not be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and, if we fail to do so, we may not be able to obtain waivers from the relevant lenders and/or amend the covenants.

Our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants described above and/or the terms of any future indebtedness from time to time could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in our being required to repay these borrowings before their due date. If we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or cannot refinance these borrowings, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. As a result, our failure to comply with such restrictive covenants could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

## We may be required to repurchase some of the Senior Notes upon a change of control triggering event.

Holders of the Senior Notes can require us to repurchase the Senior Notes upon a change of control (as defined in the indenture governing the Senior Notes) at a repurchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the applicable repurchase date. Our ability to repurchase the Senior Notes may be limited by law or the terms of other agreements relating to our indebtedness. In addition, we may not have sufficient funds to repurchase the Senior Notes or have the ability to arrange necessary financing on acceptable terms, if at all. A change of control may also constitute a default under, or result in the acceleration of the maturity of, our other then-existing indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase the Senior Notes would result in a default under the Senior Notes, which may result in the acceleration of the Senior Notes and other then-existing indebtedness. We may not have sufficient funds to make any payments triggered by such acceleration, which could result in foreclosure proceedings and our seeking protection under the U.S. bankruptcy code.

## General Risk Factors

## We may not benefit from our acquisition strategy.

As part of our business strategy, we may acquire or make investments in complementary companies, products, or technologies to augment our existing business. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or complete such acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. If we do complete acquisitions, we may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or achieve our goals and business strategy, we may be subject to claims or liabilities assumed from an acquired company, product, or technology, and any acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by our customers, investors, and securities analysts. In addition, if we are unsuccessful at integrating future acquisitions, or the technologies associated with such acquisitions, into our company, the revenue and results of operations of the combined company could be adversely affected. Any integration process may require significant time and resources, which may disrupt our ongoing business and divert management's attention from operations, and we may not be able to manage the integration process successfully. We may not successfully evaluate or utilize acquired technology or personnel, realize anticipated synergies from acquisitions, or accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction and integration of such acquisition, including accounting charges. We may have to pay cash, incur debt, or issue equity or equity-linked securities to pay for any future acquisitions, each of which could adversely affect our financial condition or the market price of our ordinary shares. The sale of equity or issuance of equity-linked debt to finance any future acquisitions could result in dilution to our shareholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations. We may acquire development stage companies that are not yet profitable, and that require continued investment, thereby reducing our cash available for other corporate purposes. The occurrence of any of these risks could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

## Catastrophic events, or man-made events such as terrorism, may disrupt our business.

A significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire, flood, or significant power outage, could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. The impact of climate change may increase these risks due to changes in weather patterns, such as increases in storm intensity, sea-level rise, melting of permafrost and temperature extremes in areas where we or our suppliers and customers conduct business. Some of our management members and other employees are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity, wildfires and other extreme weather events. If our or our partners' abilities are hindered by any of the foregoing events, we could experience sales delays, supply chain disruptions, and other negative impacts on our business. In addition, acts of terrorism, acts of war, including the evolving conflict in Israel and Gaza and Russia's war with Ukraine, other geopolitical unrest or health issues, such as a pandemic outbreak, or fear of such events, could cause disruptions in our business or the business of our partners, customers or the economy as a whole. Any disruption in the business of our partners or customers that affects sales in a fiscal quarter could have a significant adverse impact on our quarterly results for that and future quarters. All of the aforementioned risks may be further increased if our disaster recovery plans prove to be inadequate.

## Our reputation and/or business could be negatively impacted by ESG matters and/or our reporting of such matters.

There is an increasing focus from regulators, certain investors, customers, and other stakeholders concerning ESG matters, both in the United States and internationally, and companies across all industries are experiencing increased scrutiny of their ESG practices, positions, and reporting. Investors, customers, regulators, employees, and other stakeholders have focused increasingly on ESG issues, including, among other matters, climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, human and civil rights, and DEI matters. Expectations surrounding appropriate corporate behavior in these areas are continually evolving and often reflect a wide spectrum of viewpoints and interests. In addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to ESG matters are evolving, creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time-consuming. We communicate certain ESG-related initiatives and goals regarding ESG in our annual sustainability report, on our website, in our filings with the SEC, and elsewhere. These initiatives and goals, coupled with the uncertainty regarding compliance with evolving ESG laws, regulations and expectations, could be difficult to achieve and costly to implement. We could fail to achieve, or be perceived to fail to achieve, our ESG-related initiatives and goals. In addition, we could be criticized for the timing, scope or nature of these initiatives and goals, or for any revisions to them. If our ESG practices and disclosures do not meet evolving investor, customer, or other stakeholder expectations and societal and regulatory standards, or if we experience an actual or perceived failure to achieve our ESG-related initiatives and goals our ability to attract or retain employees and our attractiveness as an investment or as a business partner could be negatively impacted, which could adversely affect our business.

## Table of Contents

We are, or in the future will be, obligated to comply with new stringent climate-related reporting requirements under California climate-related reporting statutes, laws of member states of the European Union implementing the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, and other laws and regulations. These sustainability reporting frameworks will require us to provide, at least annually, detailed public disclosures about the greenhouse gas emissions and other climate-related effects our activities produce, the climate-related operating and financial risks we face, and the strategies we pursue to reduce and adapt to the impacts of climate change. We expect to incur substantial costs to prepare these disclosures. If we fail to compile, assess and report the required operating and accounting information in a timely manner and in accordance with mandatory reporting standards, we could be exposed to fines and other sanctions and sustain harm to our reputation.

## If we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, and investor confidence and the market price of our ordinary shares may decline, which could adversely affect our business.

As a public company in the United States, we are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we have expended and anticipate that we will continue to expend significant resources, including accounting-related costs and significant management oversight. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant expenses and devote substantial management effort toward compliance with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. To assist us in complying with these requirements, we may need to hire more employees in the future, or engage outside consultants, which will increase our operating expenses.

Despite significant investment, our current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. Further, weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to implement or maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement could harm our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could also adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that are required to be included in our periodic reports that we file with the SEC.

Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, subject us to sanctions or investigations by the NYSE, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities, and would likely cause the trading price of our ordinary shares to decline, which could adversely affect our business.

## Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments

None.

## Item 1C. Cybersecurity

We face rapidly evolving and sophisticated threats of breaches of our systems and networks as well as those of our suppliers and third-party service providers. To mitigate this threat to our business, we take a comprehensive approach to cybersecurity and expend considerable resources on cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance.

## Risk Management and Strategy

We integrate our policies, standards, processes and practices for assessing, identifying, and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats into our enterprise risk management program based on recognized frameworks and applicable standards. Our cybersecurity program encompasses the key elements described below:

Collaboration . We employ a cross-functional, risk-based approach to identify and address anticipated and real-time threats to our cybersecurity. Our internal security, risk, and compliance personnel meet regularly to develop strategies for preserving the confidentiality, integrity and availability of corporate, customer, and other third-party information, identifying, preventing and mitigating cybersecurity threats, and effectively responding to cybersecurity incidents. We maintain controls and procedures that are designed to ensure prompt escalation of certain cybersecurity incidents so that decisions regarding public disclosure and reporting of such incidents, if applicable, can be made in a timely manner.

Risk Assessment . At least annually, we conduct a cybersecurity risk assessment that takes into account information from our internal security, risk, and compliance functions, known information security vulnerabilities, and information from external sources, including reported security incidents that have affected other companies, industry trends, and evaluations by third parties and consultants. We also conduct risk-based cybersecurity tabletop exercises periodically to test our internal readiness and response planning.

Incident Response and Recovery Planning . Our cybersecurity program includes a dedicated cybersecurity function led by our Chief Information Security Officer ('CISO'). As part of our cybersecurity function, our Distributed Security Incident Response Team ('DSRT') administers a program to monitor, detect, investigate, respond to, and escalate management of internal and external cybersecurity threats and incidents. The DSRT provides threat intelligence information from internal and external resources to our CISO, broader security and resiliency organization, and relevant business units and functional areas as one source within our risk assessment process. Our cybersecurity function partners closely with our Data Privacy organization, led by the Business Integrity Officer, and others within the Legal organization to ensure prompt response on data breach and any other regulatory notification requirements. We have incident response and recovery plans that we test and evaluate for effectiveness in accordance with industry standards.

Third-Party Risk Managemen t. We have implemented controls designed to identify and mitigate cybersecurity threats associated with our use of certain third-party service providers. These providers are subject to security risk assessments at the time of onboarding, contract renewal, and upon detection of an increase in risk profile. We use a variety of inputs in the risk assessments, including information supplied by providers and third parties. In addition, we require these providers to meet appropriate security requirements, controls and responsibilities and investigate security incidents that have impacted our thirdparty providers.

External Assessments . Our cybersecurity program is regularly assessed by consultants and third-party auditors. These assessments include information security maturity evaluations, audits, and independent reviews of our information security control environment and operating effectiveness. The results of significant assessments are reported to management, our board of directors, and our Audit Committee. We adjust our cybersecurity processes based on these results. We have obtained industry certifications and attestations that demonstrate our dedication to protecting the data our customers entrust to us. Information about such certifications can be found on our website.

## Governance

Board Oversight . Our board of directors oversees the Company's risk management process. It has delegated to our Audit Committee the primary responsibility for executing oversight of our cybersecurity risk management processes. In performing this role, the Audit Committee receives regular reports from our CISO and other members of management regarding the prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents, including material security risks and information security vulnerabilities. The Audit Committee also considers regular updates from management on our cybersecurity risk profile based on risk assessments, progress of risk reduction initiatives, third-party auditor feedback, control maturity assessments, and relevant internal and industry cybersecurity incidents. The Audit Committee reports quarterly to our board of directors regarding the Audit Committee's activities in overseeing cybersecurity risk management.

## Table of Contents

Management's Role . Our cybersecurity program efforts are directed by our CISO who, with the support of the chief operating officer, the chief product officer, and the chief legal officer, has the primary responsibility for assessing and managing material cybersecurity risks. The CISO along with these members of our management, acting as a group, drive alignment on security decisions across the Company. The CISO and various members of this group meet quarterly with the Audit Committee to review security performance metrics, identify security risks and review mitigation strategies, and assess the status of approved security enhancements. Our CISO has served in various roles in information technology, information security and risk management for over 27 years, including serving as the Information Security Officer and Chief Security Officer of multiple companies.

Although our 'Risk Factors' section in this report presents information about the material cybersecurity risks we face, we believe that risks from prior cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, have not materially affected our business to date. Notwithstanding our investment in cybersecurity, we may not be successful in identifying a cybersecurity risk or preventing or mitigating a cybersecurity incident or product security vulnerability that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Although we maintain cybersecurity insurance, the costs related to cybersecurity incidents may not be fully insured. For a discussion of cybersecurity risks affecting our business, see 'Item 1A-Risk Factors-Risks Related to our Business and Industry-If we experience a security incident, or unauthorized access to or other unauthorized processing of confidential information, including personal data, otherwise occurs, our software may be perceived as not being secure, customers may reduce the use of or stop using our products, and we may incur significant liabilities.'

## Item 2. Properties

As a distributed company, we employ a distributed workforce with offices and employee hubs around the world. All offices are leased and we do not own any real property. We believe that our current facilities are adequate to meet our current needs and that, if needed in the future, suitable additional space will be available either to expand existing offices or hubs or open offices or hubs in new locations.

## Item 3. Legal Proceedings

The information required by this Item is incorporated herein by reference to Part II, Item 8. 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,' Note 8, 'Commitments and Contingencies - Legal Matters' included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

From time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, including patent, commercial, product liability, employment, class action, whistleblower and other litigation and claims, as well as governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings. In addition, third parties from time to time may assert claims against us in the form of letters and other communications. We are not currently a party to any legal proceedings that, if determined adversely to us, would individually or taken together, in our opinion, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Future litigation may be necessary to defend ourselves, our partners and our customers by determining the scope, enforceability and validity of third-party proprietary rights, or to establish our proprietary rights. The results of any current or future litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and regardless of the outcome, such litigation could have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors.

## Overview

Elastic, the Search AI Company, enables our customers to find the answers they need in real time, using all of their data, at scale. Our platform, combines the power of search with AI to help companies solve real-time business problems, unlock potential value, and achieve better outcomes. Our platform, available as both a hosted, managed service across public clouds as well as self-managed software, allows our customers to find insights and drive AI and machine learning use cases from large amounts of data.

We offer three search-powered solutions - Search, Observability, and Security - that are built on the platform. We help organizations, their employees, and their customers find what they need faster, while keeping mission-critical applications running smoothly, and protecting against cyber threats.

Our platform is built on the Elastic Stack, a powerful set of software products that ingest data from any source, in any format, and perform search, analysis, and visualization of that data. At the core of the Elastic Stack is Elasticsearch - a highly scalable document store and search engine, and the unified data store for all of our solutions and use cases. Our platform also includes the ESRE, which combines advanced AI with Elastic's text search to give developers a full suite of sophisticated retrieval algorithms and the ability to integrate with large language models. The Elastic Stack can be used by developers and IT decision makers to power a variety of use cases. It is a distributed, real-time vector search and analytics engine and data store for all types of data, including textual, numerical, geospatial, structured, and unstructured.

We make our platform available as a hosted, managed service across major cloud providers. Customers can also deploy our platform across hybrid clouds, public or private clouds, and multi-cloud environments. As digital transformation drives mission-critical business functions to the cloud, we believe that every company must incorporate search AI capabilities across IT and line-of-business organizations to find the answers that matter from all of its data in realtime and at scale.

Our business model is based primarily on a combination of a paid Elastic-managed hosted service offering and paid and free proprietary self-managed software. Our paid offerings for our platform are sold via subscription through resource-based pricing, and all customers and users have access to varying levels of features across all solutions. In Elastic Cloud, our family of cloud-based offerings, we offer various subscription tiers tied to different features. For users who download our software, we make some of the features of our software available free of charge, allowing us to engage with a broad community of developers and practitioners and introduce them to the value of the Elastic Stack. We believe in the importance of an open software development model, and we develop the majority of our software in public repositories as open code under a proprietary license. Unlike some companies, we do not build an enterprise version that is separate from our free distribution. We maintain a single code base across both our self-managed software and Elastic-hosted services. All of these actions help us build a powerful commercial business model that we believe is optimized for product-driven growth.

We generate revenue primarily from sales of subscriptions to our platform. We offer various paid subscription tiers that provide different levels of rights to use proprietary features and access to support. We do not sell support separately. Our subscription agreements typically range from one to three years and are usually billed annually in advance. Our subscription agreements are both term-based and consumption-based, with the vast majority of Elastic Cloud subscriptions being consumption-based. We sell subscriptions in various currencies, with the majority of our subscriptions contracted in U.S. dollars, and a smaller portion contracted in Euro, British Pound Sterling, and other currencies. Elastic Cloud customers may also purchase subscriptions on a month-to-month basis without a commitment, with usage billed at the end of each month. Subscriptions accounted for 93% and 92% of total revenue for the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We also generate revenue from consulting and training services.

## Table of Contents

We make it easy for users to begin using our products in order to drive rapid adoption. Users can either sign up for a free trial on Elastic Cloud or download our software directly from our website without any sales interaction, and immediately begin using the full set of features. Users can also sign up for Elastic Cloud through public cloud marketplaces. We conduct low-touch campaigns to keep users and customers engaged once they have begun using Elastic Cloud or have downloaded our software. As of April 30, 2024, we had approximately 21,000 customers compared to approximately 20,200 customers as of April 30, 2023. The majority of our new customers use Elastic Cloud. We define a customer as an entity that generated revenue in the quarter ending on the measurement date from an annual or month-to-month subscription. Affiliated entities are typically counted as a single customer.

Many of these customers start with limited initial spending on our products but can significantly increase their spending over time. We drive hightouch engagement with qualified prospects and customers to drive further awareness, adoption, and expansion of our products with paid subscriptions. Expansion includes increasing the number of developers and practitioners using our products, increasing the utilization of our products for a particular use case, and utilizing our products to address new use cases. The number of customers who represented greater than $100,000 in annual contract value ('ACV') was over 1,330 and over 1,160 as of April 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The ACV of a customer's commitments is calculated based on the terms of that customer's subscriptions, and represents the total committed annual subscription amount as of the measurement date. Month-to-month subscriptions are not included in the calculation of ACV.

Our sales teams are organized primarily by geography and secondarily by customer segments. They focus on both seeking to obtain new customers and on pursuing additional sales to existing customers. In addition to our direct sales efforts, we also maintain partnerships to further extend our reach and awareness of our products around the world.

We have experienced significant growth, with revenue increasing to $1.267 billion for the year ended April 30, 2024 from $1.069 billion for the year ended April 30, 2023 and $862.4 million for the year ended April 30, 2022, representing year-over-year growth of 19% for the year ended April 30, 2024 and 24% for the year ended April 30, 2023. For the years ended April 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, revenue from outside the United States accounted for 42%, 41%, and 44% of our total revenue, respectively.

We had net income of $61.7 million for the year ended April 30, 2024, while we incurred net losses of $236.2 million and $203.8 million for the years ended April 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our net cash provided by operating activities was $148.8 million, $35.7 million, and $5.7 million for the years ended April 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We had an accumulated deficit of $991.6 million as of April 30, 2024 due to losses in all prior years. We may incur net losses in the future and there can be no assurance whether, or when, we may become profitable on a consistent basis.

We continue to make substantial investments in developing the Elastic Stack and expanding our global sales and marketing footprint. With a distributed team spanning over 35 countries, we are able to recruit, hire, and retain high-quality, experienced technical and sales personnel and operate at a rapid pace to drive product releases, fix bugs, and create and market new products. We had 3,187 employees as of April 30, 2024.

## Current Economic Conditions

Macroeconomic events, including continued inflation, slower economic growth, and political unrest, continue to evolve and negatively impact worldwide economic activity. Governmental and corporate responses to these factors, including rising interest rates, unpredictable and decreased spending, and layoffs, have added to the highly volatile macroeconomic landscape. We have experienced and, if economic conditions do not reflect a sustained recovery, we may continue to experience longer and more unpredictable sales cycles, increased scrutiny of deals, slowing consumption and overall customer expenditures, and the impacts of changing foreign exchange rates with a strengthening or weakening U.S. dollar. We continue to closely monitor the macroeconomic environment and its effects on our business and on global economic activity, including customer spending behavior. See 'Risk Factors' in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of additional risks.

## Restructuring

During the three months ended April 30, 2024, we initiated a plan to realign business and strategic priorities which resulted in a reduction of our workforce. In connection with this plan, we incurred a charge of $4.2 million primarily consisting of employee-related severance and termination benefits during the three months ended April 30, 2024. The execution of this plan is expected to be substantially completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2025.

On November 30, 2022, we announced and began implementing a plan to align our investments more closely with our strategic priorities by reducing our workforce by approximately 13% and implementing certain facilities-related cost optimization actions. In connection with this restructuring plan, we recorded $0.8 million and $31.3 million of restructuring and other related charges during the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The execution of this restructuring plan was completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2024.

## Table of Contents

See Note 16 'Restructuring and other related charges' in our accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. See 'Risk Factors' included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of risks.

## Key Factors Affecting our Performance

We believe that the growth and future success of our business depends on many factors, including those described below. While each of these factors presents significant opportunities for our business, they also pose important challenges that we must successfully address in order to sustain our growth and improve our results of operations.

Increasing adoption of Elastic Cloud. Elastic Cloud, our family of cloud-based offerings, is an important growth opportunity for our business. Organizations are increasingly looking for hosted deployment alternatives with reduced administrative burdens. In some cases, users of our source available software that have been self-managing deployments of the Elastic Stack subsequently become paying subscribers of Elastic Cloud. For the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, Elastic Cloud contributed 43% and 40% of our total revenue, respectively. We believe that offering Elastic Cloud is important for achieving our long-term growth potential, and we expect Elastic Cloud's contribution to our subscription revenue to continue to increase over time. However, we expect that an increase in the relative contribution of Elastic Cloud to our business will continue to have a modest adverse impact on our gross margin as a result of the associated third-party hosting costs.

Growing the Elastic community. Our strategy consists of providing access to source available software, on both a paid and free-of-charge basis, and fostering a community of users and developers. Our strategy is designed to pursue what we believe to be significant untapped potential for the use of our technology. After developers begin to use our software and start to participate in our developer community, they become more likely to apply our technology to additional use cases and promote our technology within their organizations. This reduces the time required for our sales force to educate potential customers on our solutions. To capitalize on our opportunity, we intend to make further investments to keep the Elastic Stack accessible and well known to software developers around the world. We intend to continue to invest in our products and support and engage our user base and developer community through content, events, and conferences in the United States and internationally. Our results of operations may fluctuate as we make these investments.

Developing new features for the Elastic Stack. The Elastic Stack is applied to various use cases by customers, including through the solutions we offer. Our revenue is derived primarily from subscriptions of Search, Observability and Security built into the Elastic Stack. We believe that releasing additional features of the Elastic Stack, including our solutions, drives usage of our products and ultimately drives our growth. To that end, we plan to continue to invest in building new features and solutions that expand the capabilities of the Elastic Stack. These investments may adversely affect our operating results prior to generating benefits, to the extent that they ultimately generate benefits at all.

Growing our customer base by converting users of our software to paid subscribers. Our financial performance depends on growing our paid customer base by converting free users of our software into paid subscribers. Our distribution model has resulted in rapid adoption by developers around the world. We have invested, and expect to continue to invest, heavily in sales and marketing efforts to convert additional free users to paid subscribers. Our investment in sales and marketing is significant given our large and diverse user base. These investments are likely to occur before we realize the anticipated benefits of such investments, such that they may adversely affect our operating results in the near term.

Expanding within our current customer base. Our future growth and profitability depend on our ability to drive additional sales to existing customers. Customers often expand the use of our software within their organizations by increasing the number of developers using our products, increasing the utilization of our products for a particular use case, and expanding use of our products to additional use cases. We focus some of our direct sales efforts on encouraging these types of expansion within our customer base.

## Table of Contents

We believe that a useful indication of how our customer relationships have expanded over time is through our Net Expansion Rate, which is based upon trends in the rate at which customers increase their spend with us. To calculate an expansion rate as of the end of a given month, we start with the annualized spend from all such customers as of twelve months prior to that month end, or Prior Period Value. A customer's annualized spend is measured as its ACV, or in the case of customers charged on usage-based arrangements, by annualizing the usage for that month. We then calculate the annualized spend from these same customers as of the given month end, or Current Period Value, which includes any growth in the value of their subscriptions or usage and is net of contraction or attrition over the prior twelve months. We then divide the Current Period Value by the Prior Period Value to arrive at an expansion rate. The Net Expansion Rate at the end of any period is the weighted average of the expansion rates as of the end of each of the trailing twelve months. The Net Expansion Rate includes the dollar-weighted value of our subscriptions or usage that expand, renew, contract, or experience attrition. For instance, if each customer had a one-year subscription and renewed its subscription for the same amount, the Net Expansion Rate would be 100%. Customers who reduced their annual subscription dollar value (contraction) or did not renew their annual subscription (attrition) would adversely affect the Net Expansion Rate. Our Net Expansion Rate was approximately 110% as of April 30, 2024.

As large organizations expand their use of the Elastic Stack across multiple use cases, projects, divisions and users, they often begin to require centralized provisioning, management and monitoring across multiple deployments. To satisfy these requirements, our Enterprise subscription tier provides access to key orchestration and deployment management capabilities. We will continue to focus some of our direct sales efforts on driving adoption of our paid offerings.

## Components of Results of Operations

## Revenue

Subscription. Our revenue is primarily generated through the sale of subscriptions to software, which is either self-managed by the user or hosted and managed by us in the cloud. Subscriptions provide the right to use paid proprietary software features and access to support for our paid and unpaid software. Our subscription agreements are either term-based or consumption-based, with the vast majority of Elastic Cloud subscriptions being consumption-based.

A portion of the revenue from self-managed subscriptions is generally recognized up front at the point in time when the license is delivered and the remainder is recognized ratably over the subscription term. Revenue from subscriptions that require access to the cloud or that are hosted and managed by us is recognized ratably over the subscription term or on a usage basis for consumption-based arrangements. Both are presented within Subscription revenue in our consolidated statements of operations.

Services. Services is composed of implementation and other consulting services as well as public and private training. Revenue for services is recognized as these services are delivered.

## Cost of Revenue

Subscription. Cost of subscription consists primarily of personnel and related costs for employees associated with supporting our subscription arrangements, certain third-party expenses, and amortization of certain intangible and other assets. Personnel and related costs comprise cash compensation, benefits and stock-based compensation to employees, costs of third-party contractors, and allocated overhead costs. Third-party expenses consist of cloud hosting costs and other expenses directly associated with our customer support. We expect our cost of subscription to increase in absolute dollars as our subscription revenue increases.

Services. Cost of services revenue consists primarily of personnel costs directly associated with delivery of training, implementation and other services, costs of third-party contractors, facility rental charges and allocated overhead costs. We expect our cost of services to increase in absolute dollars as we invest in our business and as services revenue increases.

Gross profit and gross margin. Gross profit represents revenue less cost of revenue. Gross margin, or gross profit as a percentage of revenue, has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including the timing of our acquisition of new customers and our renewals with existing customers, the average sales price of our subscriptions and services, the amount of our revenue represented by hosted services, the mix of subscriptions sold, the mix of revenue between subscriptions and services, the mix of services between consulting and training, transaction volume growth and support case volume growth. We expect our gross margin to fluctuate over time depending on the factors described above. We expect our revenue from Elastic Cloud to continue to increase as a percentage of total revenue, which we expect will continue to have a modest unfavorable impact on our gross margin as a result of the associated third-party hosting costs.

## Operating Expenses

Research and development. Research and development expense primarily consists of personnel and related costs and allocated overhead costs. We expect our research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as we continue to develop new technology and invest further in our existing products.

Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing expense primarily consists of personnel and related costs, commissions, allocated overhead costs and costs related to marketing programs and user events. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, brand-building and customer acquisition and retention activities. We expect our sales and marketing expense to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our sales force and increase our investments in marketing resources. We capitalize sales commissions and associated payroll taxes paid to internal sales personnel that are related to the acquisition of certain customer contracts. Deferred contract acquisition costs are amortized over the expected benefit period.

General and administrative. General and administrative expense primarily consists of personnel and related costs for our management, finance, legal, human resources, and other administrative employees. Our general and administrative expense also includes professional fees, accounting fees, audit fees, tax services and legal fees, as well as insurance, allocated overhead costs, and other corporate expenses. We expect our general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars as we increase the size of our general and administrative functions to support the growth of our business.

Restructuring and other related charges. Restructuring and other related charges primarily consist of employee-related severance and other termination benefits as well as lease impairment and other facilities-related charges.

## Other Income (Expense), Net

Interest expense. Interest expense primarily consists of interest on our Senior Notes.

Other income (expense), net. Other income (expense), net primarily consists of interest income, gains and losses from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency, and miscellaneous other non-operating gains and losses.

## (Benefit from) Provision for Income Taxes

(Benefit from) provision for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes related to the Netherlands, U.S. federal and state, and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Our effective tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as tax rates in jurisdictions outside the Netherlands and the relative amounts of income we earn in those jurisdictions, non-deductible stock-based compensation, and one-time tax benefits or charges, including in fiscal 2024 an income tax benefit related to a release of the valuation allowance against U.S. federal and certain states' deferred tax assets.

## Table of Contents

Cost of subscription revenue increased by $27.0 million, or 12%, for the year ended April 30, 2024 compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily due to an increase of $24.7 million in cloud infrastructure costs, $1.5 million in other third-party costs, $0.9 million in software and equipment expense, and $0.6 million in intangible assets amortization. These increases were partially offset by a $1.2 million decrease in third-party consulting costs. Total subscription gross margin improved to 79% for the year ended April 30, 2024 compared to 78% for the prior year, primarily due to efficiencies realized in managing our subscription costs relative to revenue growth.

Cost of services revenue increased by $6.5 million, or 8%, for the year ended April 30, 2024 compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily due to an increase of $7.2 million in personnel and related costs. These costs were partially offset by decreases of $1.1 million in training and facility costs. The increase in personnel and related costs included increases of $4.0 million in salaries and related taxes and $3.1 million in stock-based compensation.

Other income, net increased by $5.8 million to $33.3 million for the year ended April 30, 2024 from $27.5 million for the prior year. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $19.7 million in investment income due to new investments in marketable securities and higher interest earned on money market funds. The effects of these increases were partially offset by an increase in net foreign currency transaction losses of $3.7 million. Additionally, during the year ended April 30, 2023, a one-time favorable settlement of a legal claim increased other income by $10.2 million, further offsetting the year-over-year increase in investment income.

The benefit from income taxes was $184.5 million for the year ended April 30, 2024 compared to a provision for income taxes of $19.3 million for the prior year. Our effective tax rate was 150% and (9)% of our loss before income taxes for the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our effective tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as tax rates in jurisdictions outside the Netherlands and the relative amounts of income we earn in those jurisdictions and non-deductible stock-based compensation as well as one-time tax benefits or charges. The increase in tax benefit during the year ended April 30, 2024 was driven primarily by the release of a valuation allowance against U.S. federal and certain states' deferred tax assets of $250.7 million, partially offset by tax expense in the current year resulting from growth in business operations in jurisdictions where we are subject to tax.

## Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of April 30, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaling $1.084 billion. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities consist of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities. We believe that the credit quality of the securities portfolio is strong and diversified among industries and individual issuers.

We have generated significant operating losses from our operations as reflected in our accumulated deficit of $991.6 million as of April 30, 2024. We have historically incurred, and expect to continue to incur, operating losses and may generate negative cash flows from operations in the future due to the investments we intend to make and, as a result, we may require additional capital resources to execute on our strategic initiatives to grow our business.

We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities and cash from our future operations will be sufficient to fund our operating and capital needs for at least the next 12 months, despite the uncertainty in the changing market and macroeconomic conditions. Our assessment of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could vary as a result of, and our future capital requirements, both near-term and long-term, will depend on, many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support our research and development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing of new introductions of solutions or features, and the continuing market acceptance of our solutions and services. We may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services and technologies, including intellectual property rights. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. In July 2021, we issued longterm debt of $575.0 million, represented by our Senior Notes, and we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, or if we cannot expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities because we lack sufficient capital, our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.

The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented:

## Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended April 30, 2024 was $148.8 million, which resulted from net income of $61.7 million and adjustments for non-cash charges of $123.7 million, partially offset by a net cash outflow of $36.6 million from changes in operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash charges primarily consisted of $239.1 million for stock-based compensation expense, $78.5 million for amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs, $18.0 million of depreciation and intangible asset amortization expense, $11.0 million in non-cash operating lease costs, $1.9 million from foreign currency transaction loss, and $1.1 million for amortization of debt issuance costs, the effects of which were partially offset by $217.2 million in deferred income taxes primarily related to the release of a valuation allowance, net and $8.8 million from amortization of premium and accretion of discount on marketable securities, net. The net cash outflow from changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted from an increase in deferred contract acquisition costs of $119.8 million as our sales commissions increased due to increased business volume, an increase of $63.5 million in accounts receivable, a decrease of $12.4 million in operating lease liabilities, and an increase of $1.0 million in prepaid expenses and other assets. These outflows were partially offset by inflows from a $134.6 million increase in deferred revenue and a net increase of $25.5 million in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and accrued compensation and benefits.

## Table of Contents

Net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended April 30, 2023 was $35.7 million, which resulted from adjustments for non-cash charges of $307.2 million, mostly offset by a net loss of $236.2 million and net cash outflow of $35.4 million from changes in operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash charges primarily consisted of $204.0 million for stock-based compensation expense, $68.9 million for amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs, $20.2 million of depreciation and intangible asset amortization expense, $10.9 million in non-cash operating lease costs, and $6.2 million of asset impairment charges. The net cash outflow from changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted from an increase in deferred contract acquisition costs of $102.0 million as our sales commissions increased due to increased business volume, an increase of $46.4 million in accounts receivable, and a decrease of $11.4 million in operating lease liabilities. These outflows were partially offset by inflows from a $95.6 million increase in deferred revenue, a net increase of $18.9 million in accounts payable, accrued expenses and accrued compensation and benefits, and a decrease of $9.8 million in prepaid expenses and other assets.

## Net Cash Used in Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities of $288.0 million during the year ended April 30, 2024 was primarily due to the purchase of marketable securities of $536.8 million, business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $19.1 million, and capital expenditures of $3.5 million. These expenditures were offset by cash provided by maturities and redemptions of marketable securities of $271.4 million.

Net cash used in investing activities of $273.0 million during the year ended April 30, 2023 was primarily due to the purchase of marketable securities of $270.3 million. In addition, we incurred $2.7 million of capital expenditures during the year.

## Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities

Net cash provided by financing activities of $40.1 million during the year ended April 30, 2024 was due to the proceeds from stock option exercises and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan.

Net cash provided by financing activities of $17.5 million during the year ended April 30, 2023 was due to the proceeds from stock option exercises.

## Contractual Obligations and Commitments

Our principal commitments primarily consist of our purchase obligations under non-cancelable agreements for cloud hosting, subscription software, and sales and marketing, future non-cancelable minimum rental payments under operating leases for our offices, and interest payments due on our Senior Notes. As of April 30, 2024, we had purchase commitments of $424.6 million related to cloud hosting services, future minimum lease payment commitments of $26.7 million, and purchase commitments of $47.8 million related to other contracts.

Subsequent to April 30, 2024, we executed an operating lease agreement for an office space with an expected commencement date in the third quarter of fiscal 2025. The lease term is approximately 11 years with undiscounted future minimum lease payments of approximately $12.4 million.

See Note 8, 'Commitments and contingencies,' and Note 9, 'Leases,' of our accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion of our cloud hosting obligations and future non-cancelable minimum rental payments, respectively.

In July 2021, we issued $575.0 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes in a private placement. Interest on the Senior Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year. See Note 7, 'Senior Notes,' of our accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about the Senior Notes.

As of April 30, 2024, we had $2.3 million in letters of credit outstanding in favor of certain landlords for office space. These letters of credit renew annually and expire on various dates through 2025.

Our contractual commitment amounts are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and do not include obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty. Purchase orders issued in the ordinary course of business are also excluded, as our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements.

## Table of Contents

We have also excluded unrecognized tax benefits from the contractual obligations. A variety of factors could affect the timing of payments for the liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits. Therefore, we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of such payments. We believe that these matters will likely not be resolved in the next 12 months and accordingly we have classified the estimated liability as non-current in the consolidated balance sheet. For further information see Note 13, 'Income taxes,' of our accompanying Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

## Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

In preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ('GAAP'), we are required to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported on our financial statements and the accompanying disclosures. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty and therefore require the exercise of judgment. We base our estimates, assumptions and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates may change in future periods and will be recognized in the consolidated financial statements as new events occur and additional information becomes known. Actual results could differ from those estimates and any such differences may be material to our financial statements. We believe that the critical accounting policies and estimates set forth below involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application than our other significant accounting policies.

Accounting policies that have a significant impact on our results are described in Note 2 'Summary of Significant Accounting Policies' to our accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The accounting policies discussed in this section are those that we consider to involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.

Due to current macroeconomic developments and conditions, estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty and therefore require increased judgment. These estimates and assumptions may change in future periods and will be recognized in the consolidated financial statements as new events occur and additional information becomes known. To the extent our actual results differ materially from those estimates and assumptions, our future financial statements could be affected.

## Revenue Recognition

Our contracts with customers include varying terms and conditions, and identifying and evaluating the impact of these terms and conditions on revenue recognition requires significant judgment. We apply judgment in determining the customer's ability and intent to pay, which is based on a variety of factors, including the customer's historical payment experience or, in the case of a new customer, credit, reputation, and financial or other information pertaining to the customer. At contract inception we evaluate whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single contract and whether the combined or single contract includes more than one performance obligation. We have concluded that our contracts with customers generally do not contain warranties that give rise to a separate performance obligation.

Our contracts often contain multiple performance obligations. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. We apply significant judgment in identifying and accounting for each performance obligation, as a result of evaluating the terms and conditions in contracts. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price ('SSP') basis. We determine the SSP based on the prices at which we separately sell these products assuming the majority of these fall within a pricing range. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the software license separately, we derive the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable and unobservable inputs, which can require significant judgment. There is typically more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by quantity, term of the subscription, sales channel and other circumstances. If one of the performance obligations is outside of the SSP range, we allocate the transaction price considering the midpoint of the SSP range. We also consider if there are any additional material rights inherent in a contract, and if so, we allocate a portion of the transaction price to such rights based on a relative SSP.

## Deferred Contract Acquisition Costs

Deferred contract acquisition costs represent costs that are incremental to the acquisition of customer contracts, which consist mainly of sales commissions and associated payroll taxes. We determine whether costs should be deferred based on sales compensation plans if the commissions are in fact incremental and would not have occurred absent the customer contract.

## Table of Contents

Our sales commissions plan incorporates different commission rates for contracts with new customers and incremental sales to existing customers, and for subsequent subscription renewals. Sales commissions for renewal of a subscription contract are not considered commensurate with the commissions paid for contracts with new customers and incremental sales to existing customers given the substantive difference in commission rates in proportion to their respective contract values. Commissions paid for contracts with new customers and incremental sales to existing customers are amortized over an estimated period of benefit of five years while commissions paid for renewal contracts are amortized based on the pattern of the associated revenue recognition over the related contractual renewal period for the pool of renewal contracts. We determine the period of benefit for commissions paid for contracts with new customers and incremental sales to existing customers by taking into consideration its initial estimated customer life and the technological life of its software and related significant features. Commissions paid on services are typically amortized in accordance with the associated revenue as the commissions paid on new and renewal services are commensurate with each other. Amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs is recognized in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statements of operations.

## Acquired Intangible Assets

We apply significant judgment in determining the fair value of the intangible assets acquired, which involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates can include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired customers and acquired technology from a market participant perspective, costs to rebuild developed technology, useful lives and discount rates. While we use our best estimates and judgments, our estimates are inherently uncertain.

## Income Taxes

Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply when taxes are actually paid or recovered. In addition, deferred tax assets are recorded for net operating loss and credit carryforwards.

A valuation allowance is provided against deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that they will be realized based on all available positive and negative evidence. Such evidence, which requires management's judgment, includes, but is not limited to, recent cumulative earnings or losses, expectations of future taxable income by taxing jurisdiction, and the carry-forward periods available for the utilization of deferred tax assets. To the extent sufficient positive evidence becomes available, we may release all or a portion of our valuation allowance in one or more future periods.

During the year ended April 30, 2024, we evaluated the realizability of our deferred tax assets, which resulted in releasing part of our valuation allowance for our U.S. federal and certain U.S. state deferred tax assets. Future releases of the remaining valuation allowance, if any, would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets which may include a material income tax benefit for the period in which such release is recorded. See Note 13, 'Income Taxes' of our accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion.

## Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We have operations both within the United States and internationally, and we are exposed to interest rate risk and foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of our business.

## Interest Rate Risk

We had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities totaling $1.087 billion as of April 30, 2024. Our cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash are held in cash deposits and money market funds, and our marketable securities are held in time deposits and corporate and government debt securities. The primary objectives of our investment activities are the preservation of capital, the fulfillment of liquidity needs and the fiduciary control of cash and investments. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Due to the short-term nature of these instruments, we do not believe that an immediate 10% increase or decrease in interest rates would have a material effect on the fair value of our investment portfolio. Declines in interest rates, however, would reduce our future interest income.

In July 2021, we issued $575.0 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes in a private placement. The fair value of the Senior Notes is subject to market risk. In addition, the fair market value of the Senior Notes is exposed to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of our fixed interest rate Senior Notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The interest rate and market value changes affect the fair value of the Senior Notes, but do not impact our financial position, cash flows or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the debt obligation. Additionally, we carry the Senior Notes at face value less unamortized debt issuance cost on our balance sheet, and we present the fair value for required disclosure purposes only.

## Table of Contents

## Foreign Currency Risk

Our revenue and expenses are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, and to a lesser extent the Euro, British Pound Sterling, and other currencies. To date, we have not had a formal hedging program with respect to foreign currency, but we may adopt such a program in the future if our exposure to foreign currency were to become more significant. For business conducted outside of the United States, we may have both revenue and costs incurred in the local currency of the subsidiary, creating a partial natural hedge. Although changes to exchange rates have not had a material impact on our net operating results to date, we will continue to reassess our foreign exchange exposure as we continue to grow our business globally.

We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our operating results as a result of transaction gains or losses related to remeasurement of certain asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. An immediate 10% increase or decrease in the relative value of the U.S. dollar to other currencies could have a material effect on our revenue, operating expenses, and net income (loss). As a component of other income, net, we recognized foreign currency transaction losses of $3.4 million, $0.4 million, and $3.6 million for the years ended April 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.

As of April 30, 2024, our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities were primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, Euros, and British Pound Sterling. A 10% increase or decrease in exchange rates as of such date would have had an impact of approximately $10.9 million on our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities balances.

## Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Elastic N.V. and its subsidiaries (the 'Company') as of April 30, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income (loss), of shareholders' equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended April 30, 2024, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the 'consolidated financial statements'). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of April 30, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended April 30, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.

## Basis for Opinions

The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company's consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

## Table of Contents

## Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Revenue Recognition - Identification and Evaluation of Terms and Conditions in Contracts

As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, management applies the following steps in their determination of revenue to be recognized: (i) identification of the contract with a customer; (ii) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determination of the transaction price; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when the Company satisfies each performance obligation. The Company's contracts include varying terms and conditions, and identifying and evaluating the impact of these terms and conditions on revenue recognition requires significant judgment. For the fiscal year ended April 30, 2024, the Company's revenue was $1,267.3 million.

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition, specifically the identification and evaluation of terms and conditions in contracts, is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in identifying and evaluating terms and conditions in contracts that impact revenue recognition. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating the audit evidence to determine whether terms and conditions in contracts were appropriately identified and evaluated by management.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process, including controls related to the identification and evaluation of terms and conditions in contracts that impact revenue recognition. These procedures also included (i) testing the completeness and accuracy of management's identification and evaluation of the specific terms with customers by examining revenue contracts on a sample basis and (ii) assessing the terms and conditions of the contract including their impact on revenue recognition.

## Table of Contents

## 1. Organization and Description of Business

Elastic N.V. (individually and together with its consolidated subsidiaries, 'Elastic' or the 'Company') was incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands in 2012. The Company created the Elastic Stack, a powerful set of software products that ingest and store data from any source and in any format, and perform search, analysis, and visualization on that data. Developers build on top of the Elastic Stack to apply the power of search to their data and solve business problems. The Company offers three software solutions built into the Elastic Stack: Search, Observability, and Security. The Elastic Stack and the Company's solutions are designed to run across hybrid clouds, public or private clouds, and multi-cloud environments.

## 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

## Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ('U.S. GAAP') and include the financial statements of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.

## Fiscal Year

The Company's fiscal year ends on April 30. References to fiscal 2024, for example, refer to the fiscal year ended April 30, 2024.

## Use of Estimates and Judgments

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, standalone selling price ('SSP') for each distinct performance obligation included in customer contracts with multiple performance obligations, the period of benefit for deferred contract acquisition costs, allowance for credit losses, valuation of stock-based compensation, fair value of ordinary shares in periods prior to the Company's initial public offering, fair value of acquired intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives of acquired intangible assets and property and equipment, whether an arrangement is or contains a lease, discount rate used for operating leases, and valuation allowance for deferred income taxes. The Company bases these estimates on historical and anticipated results, trends and various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions as to future events.

Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty and therefore require the exercise of judgment. As of the date of issuance of these financial statements, the Company is not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require the Company to update its estimates, judgments or revise the carrying value of the Company's assets or liabilities. These estimates may change, as new events occur and additional information is obtained, and are recognized in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they become known. Actual results could differ from those estimates and any such differences may be material to the Company's financial statements.

## Foreign Currency

The reporting currency of the Company is the U.S. dollar. The Company determines the functional currency of each subsidiary in accordance with ASC 830, Foreign Currency Matters, based on the currency of the primary economic environment in which each subsidiary operates. Items included in the financial statements of such subsidiaries are measured using that functional currency. The Company periodically re-assesses its operations to determine if previous conclusions are still valid. Changes in functional currencies are applied prospectively if the operations encounter a significant and permanent change.

For the subsidiaries where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency, foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are re-measured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates and foreign currency denominated nonmonetary assets and liabilities are re-measured into U.S. dollars at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency re-measurement and settlements are included in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations. For the years ended April 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company recognized re-measurement losses of $3.4 million, $0.4 million, and $3.6 million, respectively.

## Table of Contents

For subsidiaries where the functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar, the Company uses the period-end exchange rates to translate assets and liabilities, the average monthly exchange rates to translate revenue and expenses, and historical exchange rates to translate shareholders' equity into U.S. dollars. The Company records translation gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a component of shareholders' equity in the consolidated balance sheet.

## Other Comprehensive Loss

The Company's other comprehensive loss includes net income (loss), unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities, net of taxes, and foreign currency translation adjustments.

## Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash

The Company considers all highly liquid investments, including money market funds with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase, to be cash equivalents. The carrying amount of the Company's cash equivalents approximates fair value, due to the short maturities of these instruments. The Company's restricted cash consists primarily of cash deposits with financial institutions in support of letters of credit in favor of landlords for non-cancelable lease agreements.

Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash as reported in the Company's consolidated statements of cash flows includes the aggregate amounts of cash and cash equivalents and the restricted cash as shown on the consolidated balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash as reported in the Company's consolidated statements of cash flows consists of the following (in thousands):

|                                            | As of April 30,   | As of April 30,   |
|--------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
|                                            | 2024              | 2023              |
| Cash and cash equivalents                  | $ 540,397         | $ 644,167         |
| Restricted cash                            | 2,692             | 2,473             |
| Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash | $ 543,089         | $ 646,640         |

## Marketable Securities

The Company's marketable securities consist of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities. The Company determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation at each balance sheet date. The Company has classified and accounted for its marketable securities as available-for-sale debt securities as the Company may sell these securities at any time for use in its current operations or for other purposes, including prior to maturity. As a result, the Company has classified its marketable securities within current assets on the consolidated balance sheets.

Available-for-sale debt securities are recorded at fair value each reporting period. Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the related available-for-sale debt security as an adjustment to yield using the effective interest method. Interest income is recognized when earned. Unrealized gains and losses on these marketable securities are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss until realized. Realized gains and losses are determined based on the specific identification method and are reported in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.

For available-for-debt securities in an unrealized loss position, the Company first assesses whether it intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its entire amortized cost basis. If either of these criteria is met, the security's amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. If neither of these criteria are met, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value below amortized cost is due to credit or non-credit related factors. In making this assessment, the Company considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and any adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. Credit related unrealized losses are recognized as an allowance for expected credit losses of available-for-sale securities on the consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding charge in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. Non-credit related unrealized losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

## Table of Contents

## Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The Company follows ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, with respect to assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value. Under this standard, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the reporting date. The accounting guidance establishes a three-tiered hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value as follows:

- Level 1:   Observable inputs, such as unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.
- Level 2:   Observable inputs, other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
- Level 3:   Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

The Company's financial instruments consist of cash equivalents, marketable securities, mutual fund investments held in a rabbi trust, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities. Cash equivalents are stated at amortized cost, which approximates fair value at the balance sheet dates, due to the short period of time to maturity. Marketable securities and mutual fund investments are recorded at fair value. Accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities are stated at their carrying value, which approximates fair value due to the short time to the expected receipt or payment date.

## Concentration of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. The primary focus of the Company's investment strategy is to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements. The Company maintains its cash accounts with financial institutions where, at times, deposits exceed federal insurance limits. The Company invests its excess cash in highly-rated money market funds and in short-term investments. The Company extends credit to customers in the normal course of business. The Company performs credit analyses and monitors the financial health of its customers to reduce credit risk. Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. Management performs ongoing credit evaluations of customers and maintains allowances for potential credit losses on customers' accounts when deemed necessary.

## Accounts Receivable, Unbilled Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses

Accounts receivable primarily consists of amounts billed currently due from customers. The Company's accounts receivable are subject to collection risk. Gross accounts receivable are reduced for this risk by an allowance for credit losses. This allowance is for estimated losses resulting from the inability of the Company's customers to make required payments. The Company determines the need for an allowance for credit losses based upon various factors, including past collection experience, credit quality of the customer, age of the receivable balance, and current economic conditions, as well as specific circumstances arising with individual customers. Accounts receivables are written off against the allowance when management determines a balance is uncollectible and the Company no longer actively pursues collection of the receivable. The Company does not typically offer right of refund in its contracts. The allowance for credit losses reflects the Company's best estimate of probable losses inherent in the Company's receivables portfolio. Unbilled accounts receivable represents amounts for which the Company has recognized revenue, pursuant to the Company's revenue recognition policy, for fulfilled obligations, but not yet billed.

## Capitalized Software Development and Implementation Costs

Software development costs for software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed are expensed as incurred until the establishment of technological feasibility, at which time those costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers and amortized over the estimated life of the product. Technological feasibility is established upon the completion of a working prototype that has been certified as having no critical bugs and is a release candidate. To date, costs to develop software that is marketed externally have not been capitalized as the current software development process is essentially completed concurrently with the establishment of technological feasibility. As such, all related software development costs are expensed as incurred and included in research and development expense in the consolidated statement of operations.

## Table of Contents

Costs related to software acquired, developed, or modified solely to meet the Company's internal requirements, with no substantive plans to market such software at the time of development, and costs related to the development of web-based product are capitalized during the application development stage. Costs incurred during the preliminary planning and evaluation stage of the project and during the post-implementation operational stage are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred during the application development stage of the project are capitalized.

The Company also capitalizes qualifying implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract. These costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected life of the service contract, including consideration of the reasonably certain renewal periods, and are presented in the same income statement line items as the service for the related hosting arrangement. The Company did not capitalize any costs during the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023. All previously capitalized costs are recorded in other assets, non-current on the consolidated balance sheet.

## Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Upon retirement or sale, the cost of assets disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the financial statements and any resulting gain or loss is reflected within the consolidated statement of operations. There was no material gain or loss incurred as a result of retirement or sale in the periods presented. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.

## Leases

Leases arise from contractual obligations that convey the right to control the use of identified property, plant or equipment for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Company determines whether an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception, based on whether there is an identified asset and whether the Company controls the use of the identified asset throughout the period of use. At the lease commencement date, the Company determines the lease classification between finance and operating and recognizes a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability for each lease component. A right-of-use asset represents the Company's right to use an underlying asset and a lease liability represents the Company's obligation to make payments during the lease term. The operating lease right-of-use asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company accounts for lease components and non-lease components as a single lease component. Leases with an initial term of twelve months or less are classified as short-term leases and therefore are not recognized on the consolidated balance sheets and are expensed on a straight-line basis within the consolidated statement of operations.

The lease liability is initially measured as the present value of the remaining lease payments over the lease term. The discount rate used to determine the present value is the Company's incremental borrowing rate unless the interest rate implicit in the lease is readily determinable. The Company estimates its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at lease commencement date for borrowings with a similar term. The right-of-use asset is initially measured as the present value of the lease payments, adjusted for initial direct costs, prepaid lease payments to lessors and lease incentives.

## Acquisitions

When the Company acquires a business, the Company allocates the purchase price, which is the sum of the consideration provided and may consist of cash, equity or a combination of the two, in a business combination to the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired business at their estimated respective fair values. The Company recognizes and measures contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination on the acquisition date in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the identifiable assets and liabilities, if any, is recorded as goodwill. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management to use significant judgment and estimates, including, but not limited to, the selection of valuation methodologies, estimates of future revenue and cash flows, costs to rebuild developed technology, discount rates and selection of comparable companies. The Company's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, the Company may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations.

When the Company issues stock-based or cash awards to an acquired company's shareholders, the Company evaluates whether the awards are consideration or compensation for post-acquisition services. The evaluation includes, among other things, whether the vesting of the awards is contingent on the continued employment of the acquired company's shareholders beyond the acquisition date. If continued employment is required for vesting, the awards are treated as compensation for post- acquisition services and recognized as expense over the requisite service period.

## Table of Contents

Acquisition-related transaction costs incurred by the Company are not included as a component of consideration transferred, but are accounted for as an operating expense in the period in which the costs are incurred.

The results of businesses acquired in a business combination are included in the Company's consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.

## Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations accounted for using the acquisition method for accounting and is not amortized. The Company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that this asset may be impaired. For the purposes of impairment testing, the Company has determined that it has one operating segment and one reporting unit. The Company's test of goodwill impairment starts with a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. If qualitative factors indicate that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than its carrying amount, then a quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed. For the quantitative analysis, the Company compares the fair value of its reporting unit to its carrying value. If the estimated fair value exceeds book value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary. However, if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than book value, then goodwill will be impaired by the amount that the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value. There was no impairment of goodwill recorded for the years ended April 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022.

## Acquired Intangible Assets

Acquired amortizable intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.

|                        | Useful life (in years)   |
|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Developed technology   | 4-5                      |
| Customer relationships | 4                        |
| Trade names            | 4                        |

## Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets, including property and equipment and amortizable acquired intangible assets, for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable. Such events and changes may include: significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results, significant changes in asset use, significant negative industry or economic trends, and changes in the Company's business strategy. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of long-lived assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. During the year ended April 30, 2023, the Company recorded asset impairment charges comprising impairment of operating lease right-of-use assets and the associated furniture, equipment, and leasehold improvements of $5.1 million and $1.1 million, respectively, for exited leased office spaces associated with the Company's restructuring plan. See Note 16 for further details. The Company determined that there were no events or changes in circumstances that indicated that its long-lived assets were impaired during the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2022.

In addition to the recoverability assessment, the Company periodically reviews the remaining estimated useful lives of property and equipment and amortizable intangible assets. If the estimated useful life assumption for any asset is changed, the remaining unamortized balance would be depreciated or amortized over the revised estimated useful life, on a prospective basis.

## Revenue Recognition

The Company generates revenue primarily from the sale of self-managed subscriptions (which include licenses for proprietary features, support, and maintenance) and from the sale of software-as-a-service ('SaaS') subscriptions. The Company also generates revenue from services, which consist of consulting and training.

## Table of Contents

Under ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The Company's contracts include varying terms and conditions, and identifying and evaluating the impact of these terms and conditions on revenue recognition requires significant judgment. In determining the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as it fulfills its obligations under each of its agreements, the Company performs the following steps:

## (i)    identification of the contract with a customer;

The Company contracts with its customers through order forms, which in some cases are governed by master sales agreements. The Company determines that it has a contract with a customer when the order form has been approved, each party's rights regarding the products or services to be transferred can be identified, the payment terms for the services can be identified, the Company has determined the customer has the ability and intent to pay and the contract has commercial substance. The Company applies judgment in determining the customer's ability and intent to pay, which is based on a variety of factors, including the customer's historical payment experience or, in the case of a new customer, credit, reputation and financial or other information pertaining to the customer. At contract inception the Company evaluates whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single contract and whether the combined or single contract includes more than one performance obligation. The Company has concluded that its contracts with customers generally do not contain warranties that give rise to a separate performance obligation.

## (ii)    identification of the performance obligations in the contract;

Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the products and services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the products or services either on their own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from the Company, and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the products and services is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract.

The Company's self-managed subscriptions include both a license providing the right to use proprietary features in its software, as well as an obligation to provide support (on both open source and proprietary features) and maintenance. The Company's SaaS products provide access to hosted software as well as support, which the Company considers to be a single performance obligation.

Services-related performance obligations relate to the provision of consulting and training services. These services are distinct from subscriptions and do not result in significant customization of the software.

## (iii)    determination of the transaction price;

The transaction price is the total amount of consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for the subscriptions and services in a contract. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in the Company's judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur. None of the Company's contracts contain a significant financing component.

## (iv)    allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and

If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. For contracts that contain multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative SSP. The SSP is determined based on the prices at which the Company separately sells these products assuming the majority of these prices fall within a pricing range. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when the Company does not sell the software license separately, the Company derives the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable and unobservable inputs which can require significant judgment. There is typically more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by quantity, term of the subscription, sales channel and other circumstances. If one of the performance obligations is outside of the SSP range, the Company allocates the transaction price considering the midpoint of the SSP range. The Company also considers if there are any additional material rights inherent in a contract and, if so, the Company allocates a portion of the transaction price to such rights based on a relative SSP.

## (v)    recognition of revenue when the Company satisfies each performance obligation;

Revenue is recognized at the time the related performance obligation is satisfied by transferring the promised product or service to the customer. Revenue for SaaS offerings that relate to a specified amount of services is recognized on a consumption basis as the customers utilize the services. Revenue from SaaS offerings that are stand-ready arrangements is recognized ratably over the contract period as the Company satisfies the performance obligation. The Company's self-managed subscriptions include both upfront revenue recognition when the license is delivered as well as revenue recognized ratably over the contract period for support and maintenance based on the stand-ready nature of these subscription elements.

## Table of Contents

Services comprise consulting services as well as public and private training. Revenue from services is recognized as these services are delivered.

The Company generates sales directly through its sales team and through its channel partners. Sales to channel partners are made at a discount and revenues are recorded at this discounted price once all the revenue recognition criteria above are met. To the extent that the Company offers rebates, incentives or joint marketing funds to such channel partners, recorded revenues are reduced by this amount. Channel partners generally receive an order from an end customer prior to placing an order with the Company. Payment from channel partners is not contingent on the partner's collection from end customers.

## Contract Balances

The timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. For annual contracts, the Company typically invoices customers at the time of entering into the contract. For multi-year agreements, the Company generally invoices customers on an annual basis prior to each anniversary of the contract start date. The Company records unbilled accounts receivable related to revenue recognized in excess of amounts invoiced as the Company has an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment in the future related to those fulfilled obligations. Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue which is recognized over the contractual period.

## Deferred Contract Acquisition Costs

Deferred contract acquisition costs represent costs that are incremental to the acquisition of customer contracts, which consist mainly of sales commissions and associated payroll taxes. The Company determines whether costs should be deferred based on sales compensation plans, if the commissions are in fact incremental and would not have occurred absent the customer contract.

Sales commissions for renewal of a subscription contract are not considered commensurate with the commissions paid for contracts with new customers and incremental sales to existing customers given the substantive difference in commission rates in proportion to their respective contract values. Commissions paid for contracts with new customers and incremental sales to existing customers are amortized over an estimated period of benefit of five years, while commissions paid for renewal contracts are amortized based on the pattern of the associated revenue recognition over the related contractual renewal period for the pool of renewal contracts. The Company determines the period of benefit for commissions paid for contracts with new customers and incremental sales to existing customers by taking into consideration its initial estimated customer life and the technological life of its software and related significant features. Commissions paid on services are typically amortized in accordance with the associated revenue as the commissions paid on new and renewal services are commensurate with each other. Amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs is recognized in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statement of operations.

The Company periodically reviews the carrying amount of deferred contract acquisition costs to determine whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that could impact the period of benefit of these deferred costs.

## Cost of Revenue

Cost of revenue consists primarily of costs related to providing subscriptions and services to the Company's customers, including personnel costs (salaries, bonuses and benefits, and stock-based compensation) and related expenses for customer support and services personnel, as well as cloud infrastructure costs, third-party expenses, depreciation of fixed assets, amortization associated with acquired intangible assets, and allocated overhead.

## Research and Development

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and consist primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, bonuses and benefits, and stockbased compensation. Research and development costs also include depreciation and allocated overhead.

## Advertising

Advertising costs are charged to operations as incurred and recorded in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statement of operations. Advertising costs were $26.0 million, $22.4 million, and $19.7 million for the years ended April 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.

## Table of Contents

## Stock-Based Compensation

Compensation expense related to stock awards issued to employees and directors, including stock options and restricted stock units ('RSUs') and performance share units ('PSUs') is measured at the fair value on the date of the grant and recognized over the requisite service period. The fair value of stock options and purchase rights issued to employees under the 2022 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ('2022 ESPP') is estimated on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of RSUs and PSUs is estimated on the date of the grant based on the fair value of the Company's underlying ordinary shares. Compensation expense for stock options and RSUs is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period and over the six-month offering period in the case of the 2022 ESPP. Compensation expense relating to PSUs is recognized using the accelerated attribution method over the requisite service period when it is probable that the performance condition will be satisfied. The Company recognizes forfeitures as they occur.

## Debt Issuance Costs

Costs incurred in connection with the issuance of debt are deferred and amortized as interest expense over the term of the related debt using the effective interest method. To the extent that the debt is outstanding, these amounts are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as direct deductions from the carrying amount of the outstanding borrowings.

## Net Earnings (Loss) Per Share Attributable to Ordinary Shareholders

The Company calculates basic net earnings (loss) per share by dividing the net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, less shares subject to repurchase. Diluted net earnings (loss) per share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive ordinary share equivalents outstanding for the period, including stock options, RSUs, and ESPP shares.

## Treasury Shares

Ordinary shares of the Company that are repurchased are recorded as treasury shares at cost and are included as a component of shareholders' equity. As of April 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had 35,937 treasury shares that were repurchased at an average price of $10.30 per share.

## Segments

Operating segments are defined as components of an entity for which separate financial information is available and that is regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker ('CODM'). The Company's Chief Executive Officer is its CODM. The Company's CODM reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for the purposes of making operating decisions, allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. As such, the Company has determined that it operates in one operating and one reportable segment. The Company presents financial information about its operating segment and geographical areas in Note 15.

## Income Taxes

The Company is subject to income taxes in the Netherlands and numerous foreign jurisdictions. These foreign jurisdictions may have different statutory rates than the Netherlands. The Company records a (benefit from) provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Under this method, the Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, as well as for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the net amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized.

The calculation of the Company's tax obligations involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations. ASC 740, Income Taxes, provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, on the basis of the technical merits. The Company has assessed its income tax positions and recorded tax benefits for all years subject to examination, based upon the Company's evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at each period end. For those tax positions where the Company has determined there is a greater than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, the Company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit that may potentially be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is determined there is less than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized.

## Table of Contents

Although the Company believes that it has adequately reserved for its uncertain tax positions, the Company can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. As the Company expands internationally, it will face increased complexity, and the Company's unrecognized tax benefits may increase in the future. The Company makes adjustments to its reserves when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the (benefit from) provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.

## Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

Acquisitions: In October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ('FASB') issued ASU No. 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers, improving consistency in accounting for acquired revenue contracts with customers in a business combination by requiring that acquirers apply ASC 606 to recognize contract assets and contract liabilities as if they had originated the contracts. If the acquiree prepared its financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the resulting acquired contract assets and liabilities should generally be consistent with the acquiree's financial statements. The Company adopted ASU No. 2021-08 on May 1, 2023. The Company's adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

## New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

Income Taxes: In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, requiring enhancements and further transparency to certain income tax disclosures. The new guidance requires consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the tax rate reconciliation and information about income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. The guidance becomes effective for the Company for the fiscal year ending April 30, 2026. Early adoption is permitted. Upon adoption, the guidance may be applied prospectively or retrospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard on its consolidated financial statements.

Segment Reporting: In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, S egment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures , which provides updates to qualitative and quantitative reportable segment disclosure requirements, including enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses and increased interim disclosure requirements, among others. The guidance becomes effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after April 30, 2024 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after April 30, 2025. Early adoption is permitted. Upon adoption, the guidance should be applied retrospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard on its consolidated financial statements.

| Total                    | $ 424,552              |

Actual timing may vary depending on services used and total payments under these capacity commitments may be higher than the total minimum depending on services used.

## Other Purchase Commitments

The Company has future purchase obligations related to general corporate services, subscription software and sales and marketing contracts. As of April 30, 2024, the Company had purchase commitments of $47.8 million related to these contracts, primarily due within the next twelve months.

## Letters of Credit

The Company had a total of $2.3 million in letters of credit outstanding in favor of certain landlords for office space as of April 30, 2024.

## Legal Matters

From time to time, the Company has become involved in claims and other legal matters arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company investigates these claims as they arise. Although claims are inherently unpredictable, the Company is currently not aware of any matters that, if determined adversely to the Company, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

The Company accrues estimates for resolution of legal and other contingencies when losses are probable and reasonably estimable.

## Table of Contents

## Indemnification

The Company enters into indemnification provisions under its agreements with other companies in the ordinary course of business, including business partners, landlords, contractors and parties performing its research and development. Pursuant to these arrangements, the Company agrees to indemnify, hold harmless, and reimburse the indemnified party for certain losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party as a result of the Company's activities. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements is not determinable. The Company has never incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements. As a result, the Company believes the fair value of these agreements is not material. The Company maintains commercial general liability insurance and product liability insurance to offset certain of the Company's potential liabilities under these indemnification provisions.

In addition, the Company indemnifies its officers, directors and certain key employees against certain liabilities that may arise as a result of their affiliation with the Company. To date, there have been no claims under any indemnification provisions.

## Gain Contingencies

From time to time the Company may realize a gain contingency, although recognition will not occur until cash is received or the gain is deemed as realizable. In connection with a favorable settlement of a legal claim, the Company recognized a gain of $0.4 million and $10.4 million included in other income (expense), net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

## 2022 Employee Stock Purchase Plan

In August 2022, the Company's board of directors adopted and, in October 2022, the Company's shareholders approved the 2022 ESPP. The Company reserved 6.0 million of the Company's ordinary shares for future purchase and issuance under the 2022 ESPP in January 2023. The 2022 ESPP allows eligible employees to acquire ordinary shares of the Company at a discount at periodic intervals through accumulated payroll deductions. Eligible employees purchase ordinary shares of the Company during a purchase period at 85% of the market value of the Company's ordinary shares at either the beginning or end of an offering period, whichever is lower. Offering periods under the 2022 ESPP are approximately six months long and begin on each of March 16 or September 16 or the next trading day thereafter.

Under the 2022 ESPP, 345,165 ordinary shares were purchased during the year ended April 30, 2024. No ordinary shares were purchased under the 2022 ESPP during the year ended April 30, 2023. Stock-based compensation expense recognized related to the 2022 ESPP was $7.1 million and $0.9 million for the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The fair value of the 2022 ESPP offerings was estimated on the offering date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:

|                                 | Year Ended April 30,   | Year Ended April 30,   |
|---------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|

## 2012 Stock Option Plan

In September 2012, the Company's board of directors adopted and the Company's shareholders approved the 2012 Stock Option Plan, which was amended and restated in September 2018 and further amended in December 2021 (as amended and restated, the '2012 Plan'). Under the 2012 Plan, the board of directors, the compensation committee, as administrator of the 2012 Plan, and any other duly authorized committee may grant stock options and other equity-based awards, such as restricted stock awards ('RSAs'), RSUs, and PSUs, to eligible employees, directors, and consultants to attract and retain the best available personnel for positions of substantial responsibility, to provide additional incentive to employees, directors and consultants, and to promote the success of the Company's business.

The Company's board of directors, compensation committee, or other duly authorized committee determines the vesting schedule for all equity-based awards. Stock options and RSUs granted to employees generally vest over four years, subject to the employees' continued service to the Company. During the year ended April 30, 2024, the Company granted PSUs that vest over three years with a one-year performance period. The Company's compensation committee may explicitly deviate from the general vesting schedules in its approval of an equity-based award, as it may deem appropriate. Stock options expire ten years after the date of grant. Stock options, RSAs and RSUs (including PSUs) that are canceled under certain conditions become available for future grant or sale under the 2012 Plan unless the 2012 Plan is terminated.

Includes 132,960 PSUs granted during the year ended April 30, 2024. No PSUs were granted during the year ended April 30, 2023. (1)

Includes 16,437 PSUs canceled during the year ended April 30, 2024. No PSUs were canceled during the year ended April 30, 2023. (2)

During the year ended April 30, 2024, the Company granted 132,960 PSUs subject to performance and service conditions, with a grant-date fair value of $9.1 million, to certain executives. The PSUs become eligible to vest based on the level of the Company's achievement against a revenue-based performance goal for fiscal 2024. The amount that may be earned ranges from 0% to 200% of the eligible PSUs. Subject to the executives' continued service to the Company through the applicable vesting date, one-third of the eligible PSUs will vest following the end of fiscal 2024 and, thereafter, one-eighth of the remaining eligible PSUs will vest on a quarterly basis over two years. In the event that an executive's continuous service to the Company ceases, any associated unvested PSUs will immediately terminate and be forfeited.

As of April 30, 2024, the Company had unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of $558.2 million related to RSUs (including PSUs) that the Company expects to recognize over a weighted-average period of 2.79 years.

## Determination of Fair Value

The determination of the fair value of stock-based options on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by the fair value of the Company's ordinary shares, as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of stock options, which requires the use of assumptions including actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, expected price volatility of the Company's ordinary shares, the risk-free interest rate, and expected dividends.

Fair Value of Ordinary Shares: Subsequent to the Company's initial public offering ('IPO') on October 8, 2018, the fair value of the underlying ordinary shares is determined by the closing price, on the date of the grant, of the Company's ordinary shares, which are traded publicly on the New York Stock Exchange. Prior to the IPO, the fair value of ordinary shares underlying the stock awards had historically been determined by the board of directors, with input from the Company's management. The board of directors previously determined the fair value of the ordinary shares at the time of grant of the awards by considering a number of objective and subjective factors, including valuations of comparable companies, sales of redeemable convertible preference shares, sales of ordinary shares to unrelated third parties, operating and financial performance, the lack of liquidity of the Company's ordinary shares, and general and industry-specific economic outlook.

Expected Term: The expected term represents the period that options are expected to be outstanding. For option grants that are considered to be 'plain vanilla,' the Company determines the expected term using the simplified method. The simplified method deems the term to be the average of the timeto-vesting and the contractual life of the options.

Expected Volatility: Since the Company has limited trading history of its ordinary shares, the expected volatility is derived from the average historical stock volatilities of several unrelated public companies within the Company's industry that the Company considers to be comparable to its own business over a period equivalent to the option's expected term.

Risk-Free Interest Rate: The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for zero-coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities approximately equal to the option's expected term.

Dividend Rate: The expected dividend is assumed to be zero as the Company has never paid dividends and has no current plans to do so.

The Company's expected volatility and expected term involve management's best estimates, both of which impact the fair value of the option calculated under the Black-Scholes option pricing model and, ultimately, the expense that will be recognized over the life of the option.

The fair value of stock options granted and assumed was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:

## Table of Contents

The Company's effective tax rate substantially differed from the Dutch statutory tax rate of 25.8% primarily due to the release of the valuation allowance for most of the United States deferred tax assets and waiver of certain deductions subject to the Base Erosion Anti-Abuse Tax ('BEAT'). A reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory income tax rate to the (benefit from) provision for income taxes included in the consolidated statements of operations is as follows (in thousands, except for rates):

## Deferred Income Taxes

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Management assesses whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance where management has concluded it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income. Management makes estimates and judgments about future taxable income based on assumptions that are consistent with the Company's plans and estimates.

## Table of Contents

Significant components of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities are summarized as follows (in thousands):

|                                       | As of April 30,   | As of April 30,   |

The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of April 30, 2024 and 2023 was $386.9 million and $575.6 million, respectively. As the Company has generated losses since inception in the Netherlands and is anticipated to have cumulative losses for the foreseeable future, management maintains a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets in this jurisdiction. In addition, the United Kingdom jurisdiction is also anticipated to have cumulative losses for the foreseeable future and, as such, a valuation allowance has been established for this jurisdiction. The valuation allowance in the Netherlands and United Kingdom increased by $61.2 million and decreased by $0.2 million, respectively, for the year ended April 30, 2024 and increased by $80.1 million and less than $0.1 million, respectively, for the year ended April 30, 2023.

The income tax benefit was primarily due to the release of the valuation allowance for U.S. federal and certain state deferred tax assets of $250.7 million. The Company regularly assesses the need for a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets. In making that assessment, positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets is considered to determine, based on the weight of available evidence, whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. As of January 31, 2024, based on all available positive and negative evidence, having demonstrated sustained profitability which is objective and verifiable, and taking into account anticipated future earnings, the Company has concluded that it is more likely than not that the majority of its U.S. federal and certain states' deferred tax assets will be realizable. The Company continues to maintain a valuation allowance against its California and certain other states' deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty regarding realizability of these deferred tax assets as they have not yet met the 'more likely than not' realization criteria. The valuation allowance in the United States decreased by $250.7 million for the year ended April 30, 2024 due to the valuation allowance release and decreased by $3.6 million for the year ended April 30, 2023.

The valuation allowance for the Netherlands deferred tax assets as of April 30, 2024 and 2023 was $344.5 million and $283.3 million, respectively, the valuation allowance for the United States deferred tax assets as of April 30, 2024 and 2023 was $23.0 million and $272.7 million, respectively, and the valuation allowance for the United Kingdom deferred tax assets as of April 30, 2024 and 2023 was $19.4 million and $19.5 million, respectively. To the extent sufficient positive evidence becomes available, the Company may release all or a portion of the valuation allowance in one or more future periods. A release of the valuation allowance, if any, would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a material income tax benefit for the period in which such release is recorded.

## Table of Contents

As of April 30, 2024, the Company had net operating loss ('NOL') carryforwards for Netherlands, United States (federal and state, respectively) and United Kingdom income tax purposes of $1.237 billion, $806.9 million, $641.7 million and $78.2 million, respectively, which begin to expire in the years ending April 30, 2037 and April 30, 2025 for the United States (federal and state, respectively), with Netherlands and United Kingdom losses being carried forward indefinitely. The Company also has research and development tax credit carryforwards for United States (federal and state, respectively), Canada, Spain, and France for income tax purposes of $31.7 million, $9.3 million, $1.9 million, $0.8 million, and $0.2 million, respectively, which begin to expire on April 30, 2038, April 30, 2025, April 30, 2042, April 30, 2041, and April 30, 2025, respectively. The deferred tax assets associated with the NOL carryforwards and other tax attributes in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom are subject to a full valuation allowance.

## Uncertain Tax Positions

The calculation of the Company's tax obligations involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations. ASC 740, Income Taxes, provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, on the basis of the technical merits. The Company has assessed its income tax positions and recorded tax benefits for all years subject to examination, based upon the Company's evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at each period end.

Although the Company believes that it has adequately reserved for its uncertain tax positions, the Company can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. As the Company continues to grow in size, it will face increased complexity, and the Company's unrecognized tax benefits may increase in the future. The Company adjusts its reserves when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.

The Company had unrecognized tax benefits of $22.7 million as of April 30, 2024, of which none would impact the effective tax rate before consideration of any valuation allowance. The activity within the Company's unrecognized tax benefits is summarized as follows (in thousands):

|                                                                     | As of April 30,   | As of April 30,   | As of April 30,   |

| Balance as of beginning of year                                     | $ 18,157          | $ 16,622          | $ 13,656          |
| Increase (decrease) related to tax positions taken in prior periods | 1,201             | (1,050)           | (1,029)           |
| Increase related to tax positions taken in the current period       | 3,333             | 2,585             | 3,995             |
| Balance as of end of year                                           | $ 22,691          | $ 18,157          | $ 16,622          |

Approximately $1.2 million of the increase for the year ended April 30, 2024 for tax positions taken in prior periods is due to the filing of tax returns during the fiscal year. Approximately $3.3 million of the increase in tax positions related to the current period is primarily from the research and development tax credits generated for the year ended April 30, 2024.

The Company's policy is to recognize penalties and interest accrued on any unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. The Company recognized interest and penalties of $0.2 million for both of the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, and $0.3 million for the year ended April 30, 2022. The amount of accrued interest and penalties recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as of April 30, 2024 and 2023 was $0.4 million and $0.2 million, respectively.

The Company is subject to periodic examination of income tax returns by various domestic and international tax authorities. During the year ended April 30, 2024, the Company was subject to new audits by various tax authorities.

The Company does not anticipate any significant increases or decreases in its uncertain tax positions within the next twelve months. The Company files tax returns in multiple jurisdictions, including the Netherlands and United States. The Company's tax filings for fiscal years starting with the year ended April 30, 2018 remain open in various tax jurisdictions.

## Table of Contents

Dutch income taxes and non-Dutch withholding taxes associated with the repatriation of earnings or for temporary differences related to investments in non-Dutch subsidiaries, excluding the U.S subsidiaries, have not been provided for, as the Company intends to reinvest the earnings of such subsidiaries indefinitely or the Company has concluded that an immaterial additional tax liability would arise on the distribution of such earnings. Earnings from the Company's U.S. subsidiaries are treated as being currently repatriated back to the Netherlands, even though no Dutch income taxes or U.S. withholding taxes regarding to such repatriations are recorded due to the Netherlands participation exemption provisions and exemption from withholding taxes under the income tax treaty between the Netherlands and the United States. As of April 30, 2024, there were cumulative earnings of $212.2 million from the non-U.S. subsidiaries. If such earnings were to be repatriated, they would be exempt from taxation in the Netherlands and the amount of dividend withholding taxes from such foreign jurisdictions would be $4.4 million, due to the various income tax treaties between the Netherlands and the respective foreign jurisdictions.

## 14. Employee Benefit Plans

The Company has a defined-contribution plan in the United States intended to qualify under Section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code (the '401(k) Plan'). The Company has contracted with a third-party provider to act as a custodian and trustee, and to process and maintain the records of participant data. Substantially all the expenses incurred for administering the 401(k) Plan are paid by the Company. The 401(k) Plan covers substantially all U.S. employees who meet minimum age and service requirements and allows participants to defer a portion of their annual compensation on a pre-tax basis. The Company makes contributions to the 401(k) Plan of up to 6% of the participating employee's W-2 earnings and wages. The Company recorded $18.4 million, $17.9 million, and $15.2 million of expense for the years ended April 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively related to the 401(k) Plan.

The Company also has defined-contribution plans in certain other countries for which the Company recorded $12.7 million, $9.4 million, and $7.2 million of expense for the years ended April 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.

## 16. Restructuring and Other Related Charges

During the three months ended April 30, 2024, the Company initiated a plan to realign business and strategic priorities which resulted in a reduction of the Company's workforce. In connection with this plan, the Company incurred charges of $4.2 million primarily consisting of employee-related severance and termination benefits during the year ended April 30, 2024. The execution of this plan is expected to be substantially completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2025.

The Company also recorded facilities-related charges of $6.2 million during the year ended April 30, 2023. The facilities-related charges included impairment of operating lease right-of-use assets and the associated furniture, equipment, and leasehold improvements of $5.1 million and $1.1 million, respectively, for the exited leased office spaces. The execution of this restructuring plan was completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2024.

## Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

## Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We maintain 'disclosure controls and procedures,' as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of April 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act (a) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC rules and forms and (b) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

## Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate 'internal control over financial reporting,' as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2024 based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Based on the results of its evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of April 30, 2024. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2024 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

## Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) under the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended April 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

## Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

## ELASTIC N.V. 2022 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

1. Purpose of the Plan . The purpose of this 2022 Employee Stock Purchase Plan is to provide an opportunity for Eligible Employees of the Company and its Designated Companies to purchase Shares at a discount through voluntary Contributions, thereby attracting, retaining and rewarding such persons and strengthening the mutuality of interest between such persons and the Company's shareholders. The Company intends for offerings under the Plan to qualify as an 'employee stock purchase plan' under Section 423 of the Code (each, a 'Section 423 Offering'); provided, however, that the Administrator may also authorize the grant of rights under offerings of the Plan that are not intended to  comply  with  the  requirements  of  Section  423  of  the  Code,  pursuant  to  any  rules,  procedures,  agreements,  appendices,  or  sub-plans adopted by the Administrator for such purpose (each, a 'Non-423 Offering').

## 2. Definitions .

- (a) ' Administrator ' means the Board or any of its Committees or, subject to Applicable Law, a subcommittee of the Committee or one or more of the Company's officers or management team appointed by the Board or Committee to administer the day-to-day operations of the Plan.
- (b) ' Affiliate ' shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in Rule 12b-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act. The Board shall have the authority to determine the time or times at which 'Affiliate' status is determined within the foregoing definition.
- (c) ' Applicable Law ' means all applicable laws, rules, regulations and requirements, including but not limited to, the corporate laws of the Netherlands, U.S. federal and state securities laws, the Code, the rules of any stock exchange or quotation system on which the Shares are listed or quoted and the applicable laws of any country or jurisdiction where rights are, or will be, granted under the Plan or where Participants reside or provide services.
- (d) ' Board ' means the board of directors of the Company.
- (e) ' Code ' means the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Reference to a specific section of the Code or U.S. Treasury Regulation thereunder shall include such section or regulation, any regulation or other official applicable guidance promulgated under such section, and any comparable provision of any future legislation or regulation amending, supplementing or superseding such section or regulation.
- (f) ' Committee '  means  the  Compensation  Committee  of  the  Board  or  any  other  properly  delegated  committee  of  the  Board  or subcommittee  of  any  committee  of  the  Board.  If  no  Compensation  Committee  or  subcommittee  thereof  exists,  the  term 'Committee' shall be deemed to refer to the Board for all purposes under the Plan.
- (g) ' Company '  means  Elastic  N.V.,  a  Dutch  public  limited  company  ( naamloze  vennootschap ),  or  any  successor  to  all  or substantially all of the Company's business that adopts the Plan.
- (h) ' Contributions ' means the amount of Eligible Pay contributed by a Participant through payroll deductions or other payments that the Administrator may permit a Participant to make to fund the exercise of rights to purchase Shares granted pursuant to the Plan.
- (i) ' Corporate  Transaction '  means  the  disposition  of  all  or  substantially  all  of  the  assets  or  outstanding  capital  stock  of  the Company by means of a sale, merger, or reorganization in which the Company will not be the surviving corporation (other than a reorganization  effected  primarily  to  change  the  State  in  which  the  Company  is  incorporated,  a  merger  or  consolidation  with  a wholly-owned Subsidiary, or any other transaction in which there is no substantial change in the shareholders of the Company or their relative stock holdings, regardless of whether the Company is the surviving corporation).
- (j) ' Designated Company ' means any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate, whether now existing or existing in the future, that has been designated by the Administrator from time to time in its sole discretion as eligible to participate in the Plan. The Administrator may designate any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate as a Designated Company in a Non-423 Offering. For purposes of a Section 423 Offering, only the Company and any Parent or Subsidiary may be Designated Companies; provided, however, that at any given time, a Parent or Subsidiary that is a Designated Company under a Section 423 Offering shall not be a Designated Company under a Non-423 Offering.
- (k) ' Eligible Employee ' means any person providing services to the Company or a Designated Company in an employee-employer relationship  who  meets  such  other  initial  service  requirement  specified  by  the Administrator  pursuant  to  Section  5(c)(A).  For purposes of a Non-423 Offering and subject to the Administrator's sole discretion, this may include individuals who are employed or  engaged  by  a  third  party  agency  but  provide  services  to  the  Company  or  a  Subsidiary  or Affiliate,  at  the  direction  of  the Company or  a  Subsidiary  or Affiliate.  For  purposes  of  clarity,  the  term  'Eligible  Employee'  shall  not  include  the  following, regardless  of  any  subsequent  reclassification  as  an  employee  by  the  Company  or  a  Designated  Company,  any  governmental agency, or any court: (i) any independent contractor; (ii) any consultant; (iii) any individual performing services for the Company or  a  Designated  Company  who  has  entered  into  an  independent  contractor  or  consultant  agreement  with  the  Company  or  a Designated Company; (iv) any individual performing services for the Company or a Designated Company under a purchase order, a  supplier  agreement  or  any  other  agreement  that  the  Company  or  a  Designated  Company  enters  into  for  services;  (v)  any individual classified by the Company or a Designated Company as contract labor (such as contractors, contract employees, job shoppers),  regardless  of  length  of  service;  (vi)  any  individual  whose  base  wage  or  salary  is  not  processed  for  payment  by  the payroll department(s) or payroll provider(s) of the Company or a Designated Company; and (vii) any leased employee within the meaning of Code Section 414(n), including such persons leased from a professional employer organization, except to the extent permitted by the Administrator under a Non-423 Offering. The Administrator shall have exclusive discretion to determine whether an individual is an Eligible Employee for purposes of the Plan.
- (l) ' Eligible Pay ' means the following amounts paid by the Company or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate to the Eligible Employee (other than amounts paid after termination of employment date, even if such amounts are paid for pre-termination date services), including (i)  base  salary  or  wages  (including  13th/14th  month  payments  or  similar  concepts  under  local  law,  whether  such payments are characterized as base salary, bonus or otherwise under local law), and (ii) any portion of such amounts voluntarily deferred or reduced by the Eligible Employee (A) under any employee benefit plan of the Company or a Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate available to all levels of employees on a non-discriminatory basis upon satisfaction of eligibility requirements, and (B) under  any  deferral  plan  of  the  Company  (provided  such  amounts  would  not  otherwise  have  been  excluded  had  they  not  been deferred); but excluding (iii) relocation pay, severance payments, cash allowances for a stated purpose (such as a medical or car allowance), income derived from stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units or other equity-based awards, the cost  of  employee  benefits  paid  for  by  the  Company,  imputed  income  arising  under  any  Company  group  insurance  or  benefit program, contributions made by the Company under any employee benefit plan, and similar items of

compensation. For Eligible Employees in the U.S., Eligible Pay shall include elective amounts that are not includible in gross income of the Eligible Employee by reason of Sections 125, 132(f)(4), 402(e)(3), 402(h) or 403(b) of the Code. The Administrator shall have discretion to determine the application of this definition to Eligible Employees outside the U.S.

- (m) ' Enrollment Period ' means the period during which an Eligible Employee may elect to participate in the Plan, with such period occurring before the first day of each Offering Period, as prescribed by the Administrator.

Subject to Applicable Law, no

member of the Board or Committee (or its delegates) shall be liable for any good faith action or determination made in connection with the operation, administration or interpretation of the Plan. In the performance of its responsibilities with respect to the Plan, the Committee shall be entitled to rely upon, and no member of the Committee shall be liable for any action taken or not taken in reliance  upon,  information  and/or  advice  furnished  by  the  Company's  officers  or  employees,  the  Company's  accountants,  the Company's counsel and any other party that the Committee deems necessary.

- (b) Powers of the Administrator . The Administrator shall have full power and authority to administer the Plan, including, without limitation, the authority to (i) construe, interpret, reconcile any inconsistency in, correct any default in and supply any omission in, and apply the terms of the Plan and any enrollment form or other instrument or agreement relating to the Plan, (ii) determine eligibility  and  adjudicate  all  disputed  claims  filed  under  the  Plan,  including  whether  Eligible  Employees  will  participate  in  a Section 423 Offering or a Non-423 Offering and which Subsidiaries and Affiliates of the Company (or Parent, if applicable) will be Designated Companies participating in either a Section 423 Offering or a Non-423 Offering (within the limits of the Plan), (iii) determine the terms and conditions of any right to purchase Shares under the Plan, (iv) establish, amend, suspend or waive such rules  and  regulations  and  appoint  such  agents  as  it  deems  appropriate  for  the  proper  administration  of  the  Plan,  (v)  amend  an outstanding  right  to  purchase  Shares,  including  any  amendments  to  a  right  that  may  be  necessary  for  purposes  of  effecting  a transaction contemplated under Section 16 hereof (including, but not limited to, an amendment to the class or type of stock that may be issued pursuant to the exercise of a right or the Purchase Price applicable to a right), provided that the amended right otherwise  conforms  to  the  terms  of  the  Plan,  and  (vi)  make  any  other  determination  and  take  any  other  action  that  the Administrator deems necessary or desirable for the administration of the Plan, including, without limitation, the adoption of any such rules, procedures, agreements, appendices, or sub-plans (collectively, 'Sub-Plans') as are necessary or appropriate to permit the participation in the Plan by employees who are citizens or residents in jurisdictions other than the U.S. or employed outside the U.S., as further set forth in Section 4(c) below.
- (c) Non-U.S. Sub-Plans .  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Plan, the Administrator may adopt such Sub-Plans relating  to  the  operation  and  administration  of  the  Plan  to  accommodate  local  laws,  customs  and  procedures  for  jurisdictions outside of the U.S., the terms of which Sub-Plans may take precedence over other provisions of this Plan, with the exception of Section  3  hereof,  but  unless  otherwise  superseded  by  the  terms  of  such  Sub-Plan,  the  provisions  of  this  Plan  shall  govern  the operation  of  such  Sub-Plan.  To  the  extent  inconsistent  with  the  requirements  of  Section  423,  any  such  Sub-Plan  shall  be considered part of a Non-423 Offering, and purchase rights granted thereunder shall not be required by the terms of the Plan to comply with Section 423 of the Code.

To the extent not prohibited by Applicable Law, the Committee may, from time to time, delegate some or all of its authority under the Plan to a subcommittee or subcommittees of the Committee, to one or more of the other parties comprising the 'Administrator' hereunder, or to other persons or groups of persons as it deems necessary, appropriate or advisable under conditions or limitations that it may set at or after the time of the delegation.

## 5. Eligible Employees .

- (a) General .  Any  individual  who  is  an  Eligible  Employee  as  of  the  commencement  of  an  Offering  Period  shall  be  eligible  to participate in the Plan, subject to the requirements of Section 7 and the limitations set forth in this Section 5.
- (b) Non-U.S. Employees . An Eligible Employee who works for a Designated Company and is a citizen or resident of a jurisdiction other than the U.S. (without regard to whether such individual also is a citizen or resident of the U.S. or is a resident alien (within the  meaning  of  Section  7701(b)(1)(A)  of  the  Code))  may  be  excluded  from  participation  in  the  Plan  or  an  Offering  if  the participation of such Eligible Employee is prohibited under the laws of the applicable jurisdiction or if complying with the laws of the applicable jurisdiction would cause the Plan or a Section 423 Offering to violate Section 423 of the Code. In the case of a Non423  Offering,  an  Eligible  Employee  (or  group  of  Eligible  Employees)  may  be  excluded  from  participation  in  the  Plan  or  an Offering if the Administrator has determined, in its sole discretion, that participation of such Eligible Employee(s) is not advisable or practicable for any reason.
- (c) Limitations . Notwithstanding any provisions of the Plan to the contrary, no Eligible Employee shall be granted a right to purchase Shares under a Section 423 Offering (i) to the extent that, immediately after the grant, such Eligible Employee (or any other person whose stock would be attributed to such Eligible Employee pursuant to Section 424(d) of the Code) would own capital stock of the  Company  and/or  hold  outstanding  rights  to  purchase  capital  stock  possessing  five  percent  (5%)  or  more  of  the  combined voting power or value of all classes of the capital stock of the Company or of any Parent or Subsidiary of the Company, or (ii) to the extent that his or her rights to purchase capital stock under all employee stock purchase plans of the Company and any Parent and Subsidiaries accrues at a rate that exceeds Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars (US$25,000) worth of such stock (determined at the fair market value of the shares of such stock at the time such right is granted) for each calendar year in which such purchase right is outstanding. The Administrator, in its discretion, from time to time may, prior to an Enrollment Period for all purchase rights to be granted in an Offering, determine (on a uniform and nondiscriminatory basis for Section 423 Offerings) that the definition of Eligible Employee will or will not include an individual if he or she: (A) has not completed at least two (2) years of service since his or her last hire date (or such lesser period of time as may be determined by the Administrator in its discretion), (B) customarily works not more than twenty (20) hours per week (or such lesser period of time as may be determined by the Administrator in its discretion),  (C)  customarily  works  not  more  than  five  (5)  months  per  calendar  year  (or  such  lesser  period  of  time  as  may  be determined by the Administrator in its discretion), (D) is a highly compensated employee within the meaning of Section 414(q) of the Code, or (E) is a highly compensated employee within the meaning of Section 414(q) of the Code with compensation above a certain level or who is an officer or subject to the

disclosure requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, provided the exclusion is applied with respect to each Section 423 Offering  in  an  identical  manner  to  all  highly  compensated  individuals  of  the  Designated  Company  whose  employees  are participating in that Offering.

6. Offering Periods . The Plan shall be implemented by consecutive or overlapping Offering Periods, as specified by the Administrator, with a new Offering Period commencing on the first Trading Day of the relevant Offering Period and terminating on the last Trading Day of the relevant Offering Period. The Offering Periods shall (a) consist of one or more Purchase Periods of a duration specified by the Administrator, and (b) be of a duration, and commence on the dates, specified by the Administrator prior to the scheduled beginning of the applicable Offering Period, provided that each Offering Period may not have a duration exceeding twenty-seven (27) months. For the avoidance of any doubt,  the Administrator  has  authority  to  establish  the  terms  that  shall  apply  to  the  Offering  Periods  in  accordance  with  the  provisions contemplated in this Section 6 without shareholder approval. To the extent that the Administrator establishes Offering Periods with multiple Purchase Periods or overlapping Offering Periods, in each case, with a Purchase Price based (in part) on the Fair Market Value of a Share on the first Trading Day of an Offering Period, the Administrator shall have discretion to structure an Offering Period so that if the Fair Market Value of a Share on the first Trading Day of the Offering Period in which a Participant is currently enrolled is higher than the Fair Market Value of a Share on the first Trading Day of any subsequent Offering Period, the Company shall automatically enroll such Participant in the subsequent Offering Period and shall terminate his or her participation in such original Offering Period.
7. Election to Participate and Payroll Deductions . An Eligible Employee may elect to participate in an Offering under the Plan during any Enrollment Period. Any such election shall be made by completing the online enrollment process through the Company's designated Plan broker or, to the extent specified by the Administrator, by completing and submitting an enrollment form to the Administrator during such Enrollment  Period,  authorizing  Contributions  in  whole  percentages  from  one  percent  (1%)  to  fifteen  percent  (15%)  of  the  Eligible Employee's Eligible  Pay  for  the  Purchase  Period  within  the  Offering  Period  to  which  the  deduction  applies. A  Participant  may  elect  to increase or decrease the rate of such Contributions during any subsequent Enrollment Period by submitting the appropriate form online (or via  any  method  permitted  by  the  Administrator)  through  the  Company's  designated  Plan  broker  or,  to  the  extent  specified  by  the Administrator, to the Administrator, provided that no change in Contributions shall be permitted to the extent that such change would result in total Contributions exceeding fifteen percent (15%) of the Eligible Employee's Eligible Pay, or such other maximum amount as may be determined  by  the  Administrator  with  respect  to  a  subsequent  Offering  Period.  During  an  Offering  Period,  unless  the  Administrator determines otherwise, a Participant may decrease his or her rate of Contributions applicable to such Offering Period once by submitting the appropriate form online (or via any method permitted by the Administrator) through the Company's designated Plan broker or, to the extent specified by the Administrator, to the Administrator, by such deadline that may be established by the Administrator from time to time. A Participant also may reduce the rate of his or her Contributions to zero percent (0%) at any time during the Offering Period, provided that any such reduction shall result in the automatic withdrawal of the Participant from the Plan as provided under Section 14 hereof and the Participant shall not again be eligible to participate in the Plan until the next Enrollment Period. Once an Offering Period has commenced, a Participant  may  not  increase  his  or  her  rate  of  Contributions  applicable  to  such  Offering  Period.  Once  an  Eligible  Employee  elects  to participate  in  an  Offering  Period,  then  such  Participant  shall  automatically  participate  in  the  Offering  Period  commencing  immediately following the last day of such prior Offering Period at the same rate of Contributions as was in effect in the prior Offering Period unless the Participant elects to increase or decrease the rate of Contributions or withdraws or is deemed to withdraw from this Plan as described above in this Section 7. A Participant who is automatically enrolled in a subsequent Offering Period pursuant to this Section 7 is not required to file any additional documentation in order to continue participation in the Plan; provided, however, that participation in the subsequent Offering Period  shall  be  governed  by  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the  Plan  in  effect  at  the  beginning  of  such  Offering  Period,  subject  to  the Participant's right to withdraw from the Plan in accordance with Section 14 below. The Administrator has the authority to change the rules set forth in this Section 7 regarding participation in the Plan.
8. Contributions . The Company shall establish an account in the form of a bookkeeping entry for each Participant for the purpose of tracking Contributions  made  by  each  Participant  during  the  Offering  Period,  and  shall  credit  all  Contributions  made  by  each  Participant  to  such account. The Company shall not be obligated to segregate the Contributions from the general funds of the Company or any Designated Company nor shall any interest be paid on such Contributions, unless otherwise determined by the Administrator or required by Applicable Law. All Contributions received by the Company for Shares sold by the Company on any Purchase Date pursuant to this Plan may be used for any corporate purpose.
9. Limitation on Number of Shares That an Employee May Purchase . Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 5(c) and the maximum number of Shares that may be purchased by each Participant during any Offering Period as established by the Administrator (subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 16 hereof), each Participant shall have the right to purchase as many whole Shares as may be purchased with the  Contributions  credited  to  his  or  her  account  as  of  the  last  day  of  the  Offering  Period  (or  such  other  date  as  the Administrator  may determine) at the Purchase Price applicable to such Offering Period. Unless otherwise determined by the Administrator (in a manner that complies with Section 423 of the Code in the case of a Section 423 Offering), any amounts not applied to the purchase of Shares during an Offering Period for any reason shall not be carried forward to any subsequent Offering Period and shall instead be refunded, without interest, as soon as practicable following the Purchase Date, except as otherwise determined by the Administrator or required by Applicable Law.
10. Taxes . At the time a Participant's purchase right is exercised, in whole or in part, or at the time a Participant disposes of some or all of the Shares acquired under the Plan, or at the time of any other taxable event, the Participant shall make adequate provision for any Tax-Related Items. In their sole discretion, the Company or the Designated Company that employs or engages the Participant may satisfy any obligation to withhold Tax-Related Items by (a) withholding from the Participant's wages or other compensation, (b) withholding a number of Shares otherwise issuable in connection with the purchase of Shares under the Plan, (c) withholding from proceeds from the sale of Shares issued upon purchase, either through a voluntary sale or a mandatory sale arranged by the Company, (d) requiring the Participant to make a cash payment (by check or wire transfer) to the Company or another Designated Company equal to the amount of the Tax-Related Items, or (e) any other method determined by the Company that is permissible under Applicable Law. The Company will not be required to issue any Shares under the Plan until such obligations are satisfied.
11. Brokerage  Accounts  or  Plan  Share  Accounts .  By  enrolling  in  the  Plan,  each  Participant  shall  be  deemed  to  have  authorized  the establishment of a brokerage account on his or her behalf at a securities brokerage firm selected by the Administrator. Alternatively, the Administrator may provide for Plan share accounts for each Participant to be established by the Company or by an outside entity selected by the Administrator which is not a brokerage firm. Shares purchased by a Participant pursuant to the Plan shall be held in the Participant's brokerage or Plan share account. The Company may require that Shares be retained in such brokerage or Plan share account for a designated period of time, and/or may establish procedures to permit tracking of dispositions of Shares.
12. Rights as a Shareholder . A Participant shall have no rights as a shareholder with respect to Shares subject to any rights granted under this Plan or any Shares deliverable under this Plan unless and until recorded in the books of the brokerage firm selected by the Administrator or, as applicable, the Company, its transfer agent, stock plan administrator or such other outside entity which is not a brokerage firm.
13. Rights Not Transferable . Rights granted under this Plan are not transferable by a Participant other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and are exercisable during a Participant's lifetime only by the Participant.
14. Withdrawals . A Participant may withdraw from an Offering by submitting the appropriate form online (or via any method permitted by the Administrator) through the Company's designated Plan

broker or, to the extent determined by the Administrator, to the Administrator. A notice of withdrawal must be received no later than the last day  of  the  month  immediately  preceding  the  month  of  the  Purchase  Date  or  by  such  other  deadline  as  may  be  prescribed  by  the Administrator.  Upon  receipt  of  such  notice,  automatic  deductions  of  Contributions  on  behalf  of  the  Participant  shall  be  discontinued commencing with the payroll period immediately following the effective date of the notice of withdrawal, and such Participant shall not be eligible  to  participate  in  the  Plan  until  the  next  Enrollment  Period.  Any  Contributions  credited  to  the  account  of  any  Participant  who withdraws from an Offering according to the procedures and timing set forth in this Section 14 shall be refunded as soon as practicable without interest, except as otherwise determined by the Administrator or required by Applicable Law.

## 15. Termination of Employment; Leave of Absence .

- (a) General .  Upon a Participant ceasing to be an Eligible Employee for any reason prior to a Purchase Date, Contributions for such Participant  shall  be  discontinued  and  any  Contributions  then  credited  to  the  Participant's  account  shall  be  refunded  as  soon  as practicable, without interest, except as otherwise determined by the Administrator or required by Applicable Law.
- (b) Leave  of  Absence .  Subject  to  the  discretion  of  the  Administrator,  if  a  Participant  is  granted  a  paid  leave  of  absence,  payroll deductions on behalf of the Participant shall continue and any Contributions credited to the Participant's account may be used to purchase Shares as provided under the Plan. If a Participant is granted an unpaid leave of absence, payroll deductions on behalf of the  Participant  shall  be  discontinued  and  no  other  Contributions  shall  be  permitted  (unless  otherwise  determined  by  the Administrator  (on  a  uniform  and  nondiscriminatory  basis  for  Section  423  Offerings)  or  required  by  Applicable  Law),  but  any Contributions then credited to the Participant's account may be used to purchase Shares on the next applicable Purchase Date. Where the period of leave exceeds three (3) months and the Participant's right to reemployment is not guaranteed by statute or by contract, for purposes of Section 423 Offerings, the employment relationship shall be deemed to have terminated three (3) months and one (1) day following the  commencement of such leave, or such other period specified in Treas. Reg. § 1.421-1(h)(2) or any successor thereto.
- (c) Transfer of Employment .  Unless otherwise determined by the Administrator or required by Applicable Law, a Participant whose employment  transfers  or  whose  employment  terminates  with  an  immediate  rehire  (with  no  break  in  service)  by  or  between  the Company or a Designated Company shall not be treated as having terminated employment for purposes of participating in the Plan or  an  Offering;  however,  if  a  Participant  transfers  from  a  Section  423  Offering  to  a  Non-423  Offering,  the  exercise  of  the Participant's purchase right will be qualified under the Section 423 Offering only to the extent that such exercise complies with Code Section 423. If a Participant transfers from a Non-423 Offering to a Section 423 Offering, the exercise of the Participant's purchase right will remain non-qualified under the Non-423 Offering. The Administrator may establish additional or different rules to govern transfers  of  employment  for  purposes  of  participation  in  the  Plan  or  an  Offering,  consistent  with  the  applicable  requirements  of Section 423 of the Code.

## 16. Adjustment Provisions .

Sections 3 and 9), the Purchase Price per Share and the number of Shares covered by each right under the Plan that has not yet been exercised. For the avoidance of doubt, the Committee may not delegate its authority to make adjustments pursuant to this Section 16(a). Except as expressly provided herein, no issuance by the Company of shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price of Shares subject to a purchase right.

In  the  event  of  a  Corporate  Transaction,  each  outstanding  right  to  purchase  Shares  shall  be  equitably adjusted and assumed or an equivalent right to purchase Shares substituted by the successor corporation or a parent or subsidiary of the successor corporation.

The 'New Purchase Date' shall be a Trading Day  determined  by  the  Administrator,  in  its  discretion,  which  occurs  before  the  date  of  the  consummation  of  the  Company's proposed Corporate Transaction.

For  the  avoidance  of  doubt,  the  Board  or  Committee,  as  applicable  herein,  may  not  delegate  its  authority  to  make amendments to or suspend the operation of the Plan pursuant to this Section 17.
18. Shareholder Approval;  Effective  Date;  Plan  Term .  The  Plan  shall  be  subject  to  approval  by  holders  of  shares  in  the  capital  of  the Company at the general meeting of the Company within twelve (12) months after the date the Plan is adopted by the Board.

If, pursuant to this Section 19, the Administrator determines that the

Shares will not be issued to any Participant, any Contributions credited to such Participant's account shall be promptly refunded, without interest (unless required by Applicable Law), to the Participant, without any liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (or any Parent, if applicable).

## 20. Code Section 409A; Tax Qualification .

- (a) Code Section 409A .  Rights to purchase Shares granted under a Section 423 Offering are exempt from the application of Section 409A of the Code and rights to purchase Shares granted under a Non-423 Offering are intended to be exempt from Section 409A of the Code pursuant to the 'short-term deferral' exemption contained therein. In furtherance of the foregoing and notwithstanding any provision in the Plan to the contrary, if the Administrator determines that a right granted under the Plan may be subject to Section 409A of the Code or that any provision in the Plan would cause a right under the Plan to be subject to Section 409A of the Code, the Administrator may amend the terms of the Plan and/or of an outstanding right granted under the Plan, or take such other action the Administrator determines is necessary or appropriate, in each case, without the Participant's consent, to exempt any outstanding right or future right that may be granted under the Plan from or to allow any such rights to comply with Section 409A of the Code, but  only  to  the  extent  any  such  amendments  or  action  by  the  Administrator  would  not  violate  Section  409A  of  the  Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall have no liability to a Participant or any other party if the right to purchase Shares under the Plan that is intended to be exempt from or compliant with Section 409A of the Code is not so exempt or compliant or for any action taken by the Administrator with respect thereto. The Company makes no representation that the right to purchase Shares under the Plan is compliant with Section 409A of the Code.
- (b) Tax Qualification . Although the Company may endeavor to (i) qualify a right to purchase Shares for favorable tax treatment under the laws of the U.S. or jurisdictions outside of the U.S. or (ii) avoid adverse tax treatment ( e.g. , under Section 409A of the Code), the Company makes no representation to that effect and expressly disavows any covenant to maintain favorable or avoid unfavorable tax treatment,  notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  in  this  Plan,  including  Section  20(a)  hereof.  The  Company  shall  be unconstrained in its corporate activities without regard to the potential negative tax impact on Participants under the Plan.
21. No Employment Rights . Participation in the Plan shall not be construed as giving any Participant the right to be retained as an employee of the Company, a Subsidiary, or one of its Affiliates or Parent, as applicable. Furthermore, if the Company, a Subsidiary, or an Affiliate (or Parent, if applicable) dismisses a Participant from employment, no liability or claim shall arise under the Plan.
22. Governing Law . Except to the extent that provisions of this Plan are governed by applicable provisions of the Code or any other substantive provision of U.S. federal law, this Plan shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the Netherlands without giving effect to the conflict of laws principles thereof.
23. Waiver of Jury Trial .  Each Participant waives any right such Participant may have to trial by jury in respect of any litigation based on, arising out of, under or in connection with the Plan.
24. Headings . Headings are given to the sections and subsections of the Plan solely as a convenience to facilitate reference. Such headings shall not be deemed in any way material or relevant to the construction or interpretation of the Plan.
25. Expenses .  Unless  otherwise  set  forth  in  the  Plan  or  determined  by  the Administrator,  all  expenses  of  administering  the  Plan,  including expenses incurred in connection with the purchase of Shares for sale to Participants, shall be borne by the Company and its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (or any Parent, if applicable).

## NOTICE OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT GRANT

Unless otherwise defined herein, the terms defined in the Elastic N.V. Amended and Restated 2012 Stock Option Plan (the 'Plan') will have the same defined meanings in this Restricted Stock Unit Agreement, which includes the Notice of Restricted Stock Unit Grant (the 'Notice of Grant'), the Terms and Conditions of Restricted Stock Unit Grant attached hereto as Exhibit A, including any additional terms and conditions for Participant's country set forth in the country addendum thereto (the 'Country Addendum'), and all other exhibits and appendices attached hereto (all together, the 'Award Agreement').

[ Insert vesting schedule ]

In the event Participant's Continuous Service Status ceases for any or no reason before Participant vests in the Restricted Stock Units, the Restricted Stock Units and Participant's right to acquire any Shares hereunder will immediately terminate.

For purposes of the Restricted Stock Units, Participant's Continuous Service Status will be considered terminated as of the date Participant is no longer actively providing services to the Company or any Affiliate, Parent or Subsidiary (regardless of the reason for such termination and whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where Participant is employed or providing services or the terms of Participant's employment or service agreement, if any), and unless otherwise expressly provided in this Award Agreement (including by reference in the Notice of Grant to other arrangements or contracts) or determined by the Administrator, Participant's right to vest in the Restricted Stock Units under the Plan, if any, will terminate as of such date and will not be extended by any notice period (e.g., Participant's period of service would not include any contractual notice period or any period of 'garden leave' or similar period mandated under employment laws in the jurisdiction where Participant is employed or providing services or the terms of Participant's employment or service agreement, if any, unless Participant is providing bona fide services during such time). Actively providing services during only a portion of the vesting period prior to a vesting date shall not entitle Participant to vest in a pro-rata portion of the unvested Restricted Stock Units that would have vested as of such vesting date, nor will it entitle Participant to any compensation for the lost vesting. The

Administrator shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when Participant is no longer actively providing services for purposes of the Restricted Stock Units grant (including whether Participant may still be considered to be providing services while on a leave of absence).

By Participant's signature and the signature of the representative of Elastic N.V. (the 'Company') below, Participant and the Company agree that this Award of Restricted Stock Units is granted under and governed by the terms and conditions of the Plan and this Award Agreement, including the Terms and Conditions of Restricted Stock Unit Grant and the Country Addendum, attached hereto as Exhibit A, all of which are made a part of this document. Participant acknowledges receipt of a copy of the Plan. Participant has reviewed the Plan and this Award Agreement in their entirety, has had an opportunity to obtain the advice of counsel prior to executing this Award Agreement, and fully understands all provisions of the Plan and this Award Agreement. Participant hereby agrees to accept as binding, conclusive, and final all decisions or interpretations of the Administrator upon any questions relating to the Plan and the Award Agreement. Participant further agrees to notify the Company upon any change in the residence address indicated below. [By accepting this Award Agreement, Participant agrees to be bound by any compensation recovery or clawback policy of the Company, including the Elastic N.V. Incentive-Based Compensation Recovery Policy, as any such policy may be adopted or amended from time to time.] [By accepting this Award Agreement, Participant agrees to be bound by and, if applicable, execute the Company's, or applicable Company subsidiary's, Confidential Information and Invention Assignment Agreement in effect at the time of this Notice of Grant.]

By accepting this Award Agreement, Participant expressly consents to the sale of Shares to cover the Tax Withholding Obligations (as defined in the Terms and Conditions of Restricted Stock Unit Grant) arising from the Restricted Stock Units and any associated broker or other fees and agrees and acknowledges that, subject to Applicable Laws, Participant may not satisfy them by any means other than such sale of Shares, unless required to do so by the Administrator or pursuant to the Administrator's express written consent.

If this Award Agreement is not executed by Participant prior to the date that any Restricted Stock Units subject to this Award Agreement become vested, the Company will deem Participant to have accepted all of the terms and conditions of the Plan and this Award Agreement as of such vesting date.

## EXHIBIT A

## TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT GRANT

1.    Grant of Restricted Stock Units. The Company hereby grants to the individual (the 'Participant') named in the Notice of Restricted Stock Unit Grant that forms part of this Award Agreement (the 'Notice of Grant') under the Plan an Award of Restricted Stock Units, subject to all of the terms and conditions in this Award Agreement and the Plan, which is incorporated herein by reference. Subject to Section 17 of the Plan, in the event of a conflict between the terms and conditions of the Plan and this Award Agreement, the terms and conditions of the Plan shall prevail.

2.    Company's Obligation to Pay. Each Restricted Stock Unit represents the right to receive a Share on the date it vests. Unless and until the Restricted Stock Units will have vested in the manner set forth in Section 3 or 4, Participant will have no right to payment of any such Restricted Stock Units. Prior to actual payment of any vested Restricted Stock Units, such Restricted Stock Unit will represent an unsecured obligation of the Company, payable (if at all) only from the general assets of the Company.

3.    Vesting Schedule. Except as provided in Section 4, and subject to Section 5, the Restricted Stock Units awarded by this Award Agreement will vest in accordance with the vesting schedule set forth in the Notice of Grant, subject to Participant remaining in Continuous Service Status through each applicable vesting date, with Continuous Service Status determined as described in the Notice of Grant.

## 4.    Payment after Vesting.

- (a)    General Rule. Subject to Section 8, any Restricted Stock Units that vest will be paid to Participant (or in the event of Participant's death, to his or her properly designated beneficiary or estate) in whole Shares. Subject to the provisions of Section 4(b), such vested Restricted Stock Units shall be paid in whole Shares as soon as practicable after vesting, but in each such case within sixty (60) days following the vesting date. In no event will Participant be permitted, directly or indirectly, to specify the taxable year of payment of any Restricted Stock Units payable under this Award Agreement.

## (b)    Acceleration.

- (i)    Discretionary Acceleration. The Administrator, in its discretion, may accelerate the vesting of the balance, or some lesser portion of the balance, of the unvested Restricted Stock Units at any time, subject to the terms of the Plan. If so accelerated, such Restricted Stock Units will be considered as having vested as of the date specified by the Administrator. If Participant is subject to taxation in the U.S., the payment of Shares vesting pursuant to this Section 4(b) shall in all cases be paid at a time or in a manner that is exempt from, or complies with, Section 409A. The prior sentence may be superseded in a future agreement or amendment to this Award Agreement only by direct and specific reference to such sentence.

- (ii)    Notwithstanding anything in the Plan or this Award Agreement or any other agreement (whether entered into before, on or after the Date of Grant), if the vesting of the balance, or some lesser portion of the balance, of the Restricted Stock Units is accelerated in connection with the termination of Participant's Continuous Service Status (provided that such termination is a 'separation from service' within the meaning of Section 409A, as determined by the Company), other than due to Participant's death, and if (x) Participant is subject to taxation in the U.S. and a 'specified employee' within the meaning of Section 409A at the time of such termination of Continuous Service Status and (y) the payment of such accelerated Restricted Stock Units will result in the imposition of additional tax under Section 409A if paid to Participant on or within the six (6) month period following the termination of Participant's Continuous Service Status, then the payment of such accelerated Restricted Stock Units will not be made until the date six (6) months and one (1) day following the date of termination of Participant's Continuous Service Status, unless Participant dies following the termination of his or her Continuous Service Status, in which case, the Restricted Stock Units will be paid in Shares to Participant's estate as soon as practicable following his or her death.

- (c)    Section 409A. It is the intent of this Award Agreement that it and all payments and benefits to U.S. taxpayers hereunder be exempt from, or comply with, the requirements of Section 409A so that none of the Restricted Stock Units provided under this Award Agreement or Shares issuable thereunder will be subject to the additional tax imposed under Section 409A, and any ambiguities herein will be interpreted to be so exempt or so comply. Each payment payable under this Award Agreement is intended to constitute a separate payment for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b)(2). However, in no event will the Company reimburse Participant, or be otherwise responsible for, any taxes or costs that may be imposed on Participant as a result of Section 409A. For purposes of this Award Agreement, 'Section 409A' means Section 409A of the Code, and any final Treasury Regulations and Internal Revenue Service guidance thereunder, as each may be amended from time to time.
5.    Forfeiture Upon Termination of Continuous Service Status. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Award Agreement, if Participant's Continuous Service Status ceases for any or no reason, the then-unvested Restricted Stock Units awarded by this Award Agreement will thereupon be forfeited at no cost to the Company and Participant will have no further rights thereunder. The date that Continuous Service Status terminates will be determined as described in the Notice of Grant.
6.    Tax Consequences. Participant has reviewed with his or her own tax advisors the U.S. and non-U.S. federal, state, and local tax consequences of this investment and the transactions contemplated by this Award Agreement. With respect to such matters, Participant relies solely on such advisors and not on any statements or representations of the Company or any of its agents, written or oral. Participant understands that Participant (and not the Company) shall be responsible for Participant's own tax liability that may arise as a result of this investment or the transactions contemplated by this Award Agreement.
7.    Death of Participant. Any distribution or delivery to be made to Participant under this Award Agreement will, if Participant is then deceased, be made to Participant's designated beneficiary, provided the beneficiary designation is valid under Applicable Laws and permitted by the Company for Participant's jurisdiction, or if no beneficiary survives Participant, the administrator or executor of Participant's estate. Any such transferee must furnish the Company with (a) written notice of his or her status as transferee, and (b) evidence satisfactory to the Company to establish the validity of the transfer and compliance with any laws or regulations pertaining to said transfer.

## 8.    Tax Obligations

- (a)    Responsibility for Taxes. Participant acknowledges that, regardless of any action taken by the Company or, if different, the Affiliate, Parent or Subsidiary to which Participant is providing services (the 'Service Recipient'), the ultimate liability for any tax and/or social insurance liability obligations and requirements in connection with the Restricted Stock Units, including, without limitation, (i) all U.S. and non-U.S. federal, state, and local taxes (including Participant's U.S. Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) obligation) that are required to be withheld by the Company or the Service Recipient or other payment of tax-related items related to Participant's participation in the Plan and legally applicable to Participant, (ii) Participant's and, to the extent required by the Company (or Service Recipient), the Company's (or Service Recipient's) fringe benefit tax liability, if any, associated with the grant, vesting, or settlement of the Restricted Stock Units or sale of Shares, and (iii) any other Company (or Service Recipient) taxes the responsibility for which Participant has, or has agreed to bear, with respect to the Restricted Stock Units (or settlement thereof or issuance of Shares thereunder) (collectively, the 'Tax Obligations'), is and remains Participant's responsibility and may exceed the amount, if any, actually withheld by the Company or the Service Recipient. Participant further acknowledges that the Company and/or the Service Recipient (A) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax Obligations in connection with any aspect of the Restricted Stock Units, including, but not limited to, the grant, vesting or settlement of the Restricted Stock Units, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such settlement and the receipt of any dividends or other distributions, and (B) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Restricted Stock Units to reduce or eliminate Participant's liability for Tax Obligations or achieve any particular tax result. Further, if Participant is subject to Tax Obligations in more than one jurisdiction, Participant acknowledges that the Company and/or the Service Recipient (or former service recipient, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax Obligations in more than one jurisdiction. If Participant fails to make satisfactory arrangements for the payment of any required Tax Obligations hereunder at the time of the

applicable taxable event, Participant acknowledges and agrees that the Company may refuse to issue or deliver the Shares.

(b)    Tax Withholding and Default Sell-to-Cover Method of Tax Withholding. When Shares are issued as payment for vested Restricted Stock Units, Participant generally will recognize immediate U.S. taxable income if Participant is subject to taxation in the U.S. If Participant is subject to taxation in any other jurisdiction, Participant will be subject to applicable taxes, if any, in such jurisdiction at the time of the taxable event, as determined under local law. Subject to Section 8(c) and Applicable Laws, the amount of Tax Obligations which the Company determines must be withheld with respect to this Award ('Tax Withholding Obligation') will be satisfied by Shares being sold on Participant's behalf at the prevailing market price pursuant to such procedures as the Administrator may specify from time to time, including through a broker-assisted arrangement (it being understood that the Shares to be sold must have vested pursuant to the terms of this Award Agreement and the Plan) (the 'Sell-to-Cover Method'). The proceeds from the Sell-to-Cover Method will be used to satisfy Participant's Tax Withholding Obligation arising with respect to this Award. In addition to Shares sold to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation, additional Shares will be sold to satisfy any associated broker or other fees. Only whole Shares will be sold through the Sell-to-Cover Method to satisfy any Tax Withholding Obligation and any associated broker or other fees. Any proceeds from the sale of Shares in excess of the Tax Withholding Obligation and any associated broker or other fees generated through the Sell-to-Cover Method will be paid to Participant in accordance with procedures the Company may specify from time to time. By accepting this Award, Participant expressly consents to the sale of Shares to cover the Tax Withholding Obligations (and any associated broker or other fees) through the Sell-to-Cover Method and agrees and acknowledges that, subject to Applicable Laws, Participant may not satisfy them by any means other than such sale of Shares, unless required to do so by the Administrator or pursuant to the Administrator's express written consent.

(c)    Administrator Discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing Sections 8(a) and 8(b), if the Administrator determines it is in the best interests of the Company for Participant to satisfy Participant's Tax Withholding Obligation by a method other than through the default Sell-to-Cover Method described in Section 8(b), it may permit or require Participant to satisfy Participant's Tax Withholding Obligation, in whole or in part (without limitation), if permissible by Applicable Laws, by (i) paying cash, (ii) withholding the amount of such Tax Withholding Obligation from Participant's wages or other cash compensation paid to Participant by the Company and/or the Service Recipient, (iii) if Participant is a U.S. employee, delivering to the Company Shares that Participant owns and that have vested with a fair market value equal to the amount required to be withheld (or such other amount, up to the maximum withholding rate in Participant's country, determined by the Administrator and provided such other amount would not result in adverse financial accounting consequences to the Company as determined by the Administrator), (iv) by having the Company withhold otherwise deliverable Shares having a fair market value equal to the amount required to be withheld (or such other amount, up to the maximum withholding rate in Participant's country, determined by the Administrator and provided such other amount would not result in adverse financial accounting consequences to the Company as determined by the Administrator), and, unless the Administrator provides otherwise, this will be the default method for satisfying Participant's Tax Withholding Obligations if Participant has not executed this Award Agreement or otherwise failed to take actions necessary to facilitate the Sell-to-Cover Method prior to the date that any Restricted Stock Units under this Award Agreement become vested, or (v) such other means as the Administrator deems appropriate.

(d)    Company's Obligation to Deliver Shares. For clarification purposes, in no event will the Company issue Participant any Shares unless and until arrangements satisfactory to the Administrator have been made for the payment of Participant's Tax Withholding Obligation. If Participant fails to make satisfactory arrangements for the payment of such Tax Withholding Obligations hereunder at the time any applicable Restricted Stock Units otherwise are scheduled to vest pursuant to Sections 3 or 4 or Participant's Tax Withholding Obligations otherwise become due, Participant will permanently forfeit such Restricted Stock Units to which Participant's Tax Withholding Obligation relates and any right to receive Shares thereunder and such Restricted Stock Units will be returned to the Company at no cost to the Company. Participant acknowledges and agrees that the Company may refuse to issue or deliver the Shares if such Tax Obligations are not delivered at the time they are due.

9.    Rights as Shareholder. Neither Participant nor any person claiming under or through Participant will have any of the rights or privileges of a shareholder of the Company in respect of any Shares deliverable hereunder

unless and until such Shares (which are in book entry form) will have been issued and delivered to Participant (including through electronic delivery to a brokerage account). Such issuance will occur by the execution of a deed of issuance to which the Company and Participant are each party, unless the Shares will be delivered into a brokerage account in the name of Participant, in which case the issuance will take place by a deed of issuance with due observance of the relevant requirements that may apply from time to time. After such issuance and delivery, Participant will have all the rights of a shareholder of the Company with respect to voting such Shares and receipt of dividends and distributions on such Shares.

10.    No Guarantee of Continued Service. PARTICIPANT ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THE VESTING OF THE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS PURSUANT TO THE VESTING SCHEDULE HEREOF IS EARNED ONLY BY REMAINING IN CONTINUOUS SERVICE STATUS, WHICH UNLESS PROVIDED OTHERWISE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW IS AT THE WILL OF THE COMPANY (OR THE SERVICE RECIPIENT) AND NOT THROUGH THE ACT OF BEING HIRED, BEING GRANTED THIS RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD OR ACQUIRING SHARES HEREUNDER. PARTICIPANT FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THIS AWARD AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREUNDER AND THE VESTING SCHEDULE SET FORTH HEREIN DO NOT CONSTITUTE AN EXPRESS OR IMPLIED PROMISE OF CONTINUED ENGAGEMENT AS AN EMPLOYEE OR CONSULTANT FOR THE VESTING PERIOD, FOR ANY PERIOD, OR AT ALL, AND SHALL NOT INTERFERE IN ANY WAY WITH PARTICIPANT'S RIGHT OR THE RIGHT OF THE COMPANY (OR THE SERVICE RECIPIENT) TO TERMINATE PARTICIPANT'S CONTINUOUS SERVICE STATUS, SUBJECT TO APPLICABLE LAW, WHICH TERMINATION, UNLESS PROVIDED OTHERWISE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, MAY BE AT ANY TIME, WITH OR WITHOUT CAUSE.
11.    Grant is Not Transferable. Except to the limited extent provided in Section 7, this grant and the rights and privileges conferred hereby will not be transferred, assigned, pledged or hypothecated in any way (whether by operation of law or otherwise) and will not be subject to sale under execution, attachment or similar process. Upon any attempt to transfer, assign, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of this grant, or any right or privilege conferred hereby, or upon any attempted sale under any execution, attachment or similar process, this grant and the rights and privileges conferred hereby immediately will become null and void.
12.    Nature of Grant. In accepting the grant, Participant acknowledges, understands, and agrees that:
4. (a)    the Plan is established voluntarily by the Company, it is discretionary in nature and it may be modified, amended, suspended or terminated by the Company at any time, to the extent permitted by the Plan;
5. (b)    the grant of the Restricted Stock Units is exceptional, voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future grants of Restricted Stock Units, or benefits in lieu of Restricted Stock Units, even if Restricted Stock Units have been granted in the past;
6. (c)    all decisions with respect to future Restricted Stock Units or other grants, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company;
7. (d)    the grant of the Restricted Stock Units and Participant's participation in the Plan shall not create a right to employment, other service relationship, or be interpreted as forming or amending an employment or service contract with the Company, the Service Recipient or any other Affiliate, Parent or Subsidiary, and shall not interfere with the ability of the Company, the Service Recipient or any other Affiliate, Parent or Subsidiary, as applicable, to terminate Participant's employment or other service relationship, if any;
8. (e)    Participant is voluntarily participating in the Plan;
9. (f)    the Restricted Stock Units and the Shares subject to the Restricted Stock Units, and the income from and value of same, are not intended to replace any pension rights or compensation;
10. (g)    the Restricted Stock Units and the Shares subject to the Restricted Stock Units, and the income from and value of same, are not part of normal or expected compensation for any purpose, including without

limitation, calculating any severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, dismissal, end-of-service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, leave-related payments, holiday pay, holiday top-up, pension or retirement or welfare benefits or similar mandatory payments;

- (h)    unless otherwise agreed in writing with the Company, the Restricted Stock Units and the Shares subject to the Restricted Stock Units, and the income from and value of same, are not granted as consideration for, or in connection with, the service Participant may provide as a director of an Affiliate, Parent or Subsidiary;
- (i)    the future value of the underlying Shares is unknown, indeterminable and cannot be predicted with certainty;
- (j)    no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from forfeiture of the Restricted Stock Units or any underlying Shares resulting from (i) the application of any compensation recovery or clawback policy adopted by the Company or required by law, or (ii) the termination of Participant's Continuous Service Status (for any reason whatsoever whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where Participant is employed or providing services or the terms of Participant's employment or service agreement, if any);
- (k)    unless otherwise provided in the Plan or by the Company in its discretion, the Restricted Stock Units and the benefits evidenced by this Award Agreement do not create any entitlement to have the Restricted Stock Units or any such benefits transferred to, or assumed by, another company nor be exchanged, cashed out or substituted for, in connection with any corporate transaction affecting the Shares; and
- (l)    neither the Company nor the Service Recipient or any other Affiliate, Parent or Subsidiary shall be liable for any foreign exchange rate fluctuation between Participant's local currency and the United States Dollar that may affect the value of the Restricted Stock Units or of any amounts due to Participant pursuant to the settlement of the Restricted Stock Units or the subsequent sale of any Shares acquired upon settlement.
13.    No Advice Regarding Grant. The Company is not providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor is the Company making any recommendations regarding Participant's participation in the Plan, or Participant's acquisition or sale of the underlying Shares. Participant is hereby advised to consult with his or her own personal tax, legal and financial advisors regarding his or her participation in the Plan before taking any action related to the Plan.
14. Data Privacy. Participant hereby explicitly and unambiguously consents to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of Participant's personal data as described in this Award Agreement and any other Restricted Stock Unit grant materials by and among, as applicable, the Service Recipient, the Company and any other Affiliate, Parent or Subsidiary for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing Participant's participation in the Plan.

Participant understands that the Company and the Service Recipient may hold certain personal information about Participant, including, but not limited to, Participant's name, home address and telephone number, email address, date of birth, social insurance number (to the extent permitted under Applicable Laws), passport or other identification number (e.g., resident registration number), salary, nationality, job title, any Shares or directorships held in the Company, details of all Restricted Stock Units or any other entitlement to Shares or equivalent benefits awarded, canceled, purchased, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in Participant's favor ('Data'), for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Plan.

Participant understands that Data will be transferred to such stock plan service provider(s) as may be selected by the Company (currently Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC, the brokerage firm engaged by the Company to hold participants' Shares and other amounts acquired under the Plan, and its affiliated companies (collectively, "the Designated Broker")) to assist with the implementation, administration, and management of the Plan. The recipients of Data may be located in the United States or elsewhere, and each recipient's country of operation (e.g., the United States) may have different data privacy laws and protections than Participant's country. Depending on where Participant is based, such rights may include the right to request a list with the names and addresses of any

potential recipients of Data by contacting his or her local human resources representative. Participant authorizes the Company, any stock plan service provider selected by the Company and any other possible recipients which may assist the Company (presently or in the future) with implementing, administering and managing the Plan to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer Data, in electronic or other form, for the sole purpose of implementing, administering and managing his or her participation in the Plan, including any requisite transfer of such Data as may be required to a broker, escrow agent or other third party with whom Participant may elect to deposit any Shares received upon vesting of the Restricted Stock Units. Participant understands that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage Participant's participation in the Plan. Participant may have a number of rights under data privacy laws in Participant's jurisdiction. Depending on where Participant is based, such rights may include the right to, at any time, view Data, request information about the storage and processing of Data, require any necessary amendments to Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein, in any case without cost, by contacting his or her local human resources representative. Further, Participant understands that he or she is providing the consents herein on a purely voluntary basis. If Participant does not consent, or if Participant later seeks to revoke his or her consent, his or her employment or service with the Service Recipient will not be affected; the only consequence of refusing or withdrawing Participant's consent is that the Company would not be able to grant Participant Restricted Stock Units or other equity awards or administer or maintain such awards. Therefore, Participant understands that refusing or withdrawing his or her consent may affect Participant's ability to participate in the Plan. For more information on the consequences of Participant's refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, Participant may contact his or her local human resources representative.

Finally, Participant understands that the Company may rely on a different basis for the processing or transfer of Data in the future and/or request that Participant provide another data privacy consent. If applicable, Participant agrees that upon request of the Company or the Service Recipient, Participant will provide an executed acknowledgement or data privacy consent form (or any other agreements or consents) that the Company and/or the Service Recipient may deem necessary to obtain from Participant for the purpose of administering Participant's participation in the Plan in compliance with the data privacy laws in Participant's country, either now or in the future. Participant understands and agrees that he or she will not be able to participate in the Plan if he or she fails to provide any such consent or agreement requested by the Company and/or the Service Recipient.

15.    Address for Notices. Any notice to be given to the Company under the terms of this Award Agreement will be addressed to the Company at Elastic N.V., 88 Kearny St. Floor 19, San Francisco, California 94108 or at such other address as the Company may hereafter designate in writing.
16.    Electronic Delivery and Participation. The Company may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents related to the Restricted Stock Units awarded under the Plan or future Restricted Stock Units that may be awarded under the Plan by electronic means or request Participant's consent to participate in the Plan by electronic means. Participant hereby consents to receive such documents by electronic delivery and agrees to participate in the Plan through any online or electronic system established and maintained by the Company or a third party designated by the Company.
17.    No Waiver. Either party's failure to enforce any provision or provisions of this Award Agreement shall not in any way be construed as a waiver of any such provision or provisions, nor prevent that party from thereafter enforcing each and every other provision of this Award Agreement. The rights granted both parties herein are cumulative and shall not constitute a waiver of either party's right to assert all other legal remedies available to it under the circumstances.
18.    Successors and Assigns. The Company may assign any of its rights under this Award Agreement to single or multiple assignees, and this Award Agreement shall inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the Company. Subject to the restrictions on transfer herein set forth, this Award Agreement shall be binding upon Participant and his or her heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns. The rights and obligations of Participant under this Award Agreement may only be assigned with the prior written consent of the Company.
19.    Additional Conditions to Issuance of Shares. If at any time the Company determines, in its discretion, that the listing, registration, qualification or rule compliance of the Shares upon any securities exchange or under any

## AMENDED AND RESTATED 2012 STOCK OPTION PLAN RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT COUNTRY ADDENDUM

Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning given to such terms in the Plan, the Notice of Restricted Stock Unit Grant or the Terms and Conditions of Restricted Stock Unit Grant, as applicable.

## Terms and Conditions

This Country Addendum includes additional terms and conditions that govern the Award of Restricted Stock Units granted to Participant under the Plan if Participant resides and/or works in one of the countries listed below. If Participant is a citizen or resident of a jurisdiction (or is considered as such for local law purposes) other than the one(s) in which he or she is currently residing and/or working or if Participant relocates to another jurisdiction after receiving the Award of Restricted Stock Units, the Company will, in its sole discretion, determine the extent to which the terms and conditions contained herein will be applicable to Participant.

## Notifications

This Country Addendum also includes notifications relating to exchange control and certain other issues of which Participant should be aware with respect to his or her participation in the Plan. The information is based on the exchange control, securities and other laws in effect in the respective countries listed in this Country Addendum, as of [date].

## ELASTIC N.V. AMENDED AND RESTATED 2012 STOCK OPTION PLAN PERFORMANCE UNIT AGREEMENT

## NOTICE OF PERFORMANCE UNIT GRANT

Unless otherwise defined herein, the terms defined in the Elastic N.V. Amended and Restated 2012 Stock Option Plan (the 'Plan') will have the same defined meanings in this Performance Unit Agreement, which includes the Notice of Performance Unit Grant (the 'Notice of Grant'), the Performance Goal attached hereto as Schedule I, the Terms and Conditions of Performance Unit Grant, attached hereto as Exhibit A, including any additional terms and conditions for Participant's country set forth in the country addendum  thereto  (the  'Country  Addendum'),  and  all  other  exhibits  and  appendices  attached  hereto  (all  together,  the  'Award Agreement').

## Participant:

## Address:    «Address»

The undersigned Participant has been granted the right to receive an Award of Performance Units, subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and this Award Agreement, as follows:

Grant Number:

Date of Grant:

Number of Performance Units:

## Vesting Schedule:

Subject  to  any  acceleration  provisions  contained  in  the  Plan,  the  Performance  Units  will  vest  in  accordance  with  the following schedule:

1. Performance  Units  shall  become  eligible  to  vest  (and  shall  be  'Eligible  Performance  Units')  based  on  the  level  of  the Company's achievement against the applicable performance goal set forth on Schedule I (the 'Performance Goal') for the Company's  fiscal  year  \_\_\_\_\_  (such  period,  the  'Performance  Period,'  and  the  last  day  of  the  Performance  Period,  the 'Measurement Date'). As soon as practicable following the Measurement Date, the Administrator shall, in its sole discretion, make  a  written  determination  of  the  extent  which  the  Company's  performance  against  the  Performance  Goal  has  been satisfied (the 'Level of Attainment'). The date of such determination is the 'Determination Date.'
2. Based on the Level of Attainment, the number of Eligible Performance Units shall be determined as indicated on Schedule I. The Administrator retains the discretion to adjust its determination of the number of Eligible Performance Units up or down from the actual Level of Attainment. Such determination shall be final, conclusive, and binding.
3. [Insert vesting schedule].
4. In  the  event  of  a  Change  in  Control  prior  to  the  Measurement  Date,  the  Performance  Units  shall  convert  to  time-based vesting, based on the Number of Performance Units as indicated in the Notice of Grant, unless actual performance measured as  of  the  date  of  the  closing  of  the  Change  in  Control  can  be  determined  and  results  in  a  higher  number  of  Eligible Performance Units. In that event, the number of Eligible Performance Units shall be the

number of Performance Units determined based on actual performance. Following conversion, Eligible Performance Units shall [Insert vesting schedule].

5. If  the  application  of  a  vesting  percentage  would  cause  only  part  of  an  Eligible  Performance  Unit  to  vest,  such  Eligible Performance Unit shall not vest until the next regular vesting date.
6. In the event Participant's Continuous Service Status ceases for any or no reason, before Participant vests in the Performance Units, the Performance Units and Participant's right to acquire any Shares hereunder will immediately terminate.

For purposes of the Performance Units, Participant's Continuous Service Status will be considered terminated as of the date Participant is no longer actively providing services to the Company or any Affiliate, Parent or Subsidiary (regardless of the reason for  such  termination  and  whether  or  not  later  found  to  be  invalid  or  in  breach  of  employment  laws  in  the  jurisdiction  where Participant is employed or providing services or the terms of Participant's employment or service agreement, if any), and unless otherwise  expressly  provided  in  this Award Agreement  (including  by  reference  in  the  Notice  of  Grant  to  other  arrangements  or contracts)  or  determined  by  the  Administrator,  Participant's  right  to  vest  in  the  Performance  Units  under  the  Plan,  if  any,  will terminate as of such date and will not be extended by any notice period (e.g., Participant's period of service would not include any contractual notice period or any period of 'garden leave' or similar period mandated under employment laws in the jurisdiction where Participant is employed or providing services or the terms of Participant's employment or service agreement, if any, unless Participant is providing bona fide services during such time). Actively providing services during only a portion of the vesting period prior to a vesting date shall not entitle Participant to vest in a pro-rata portion of the unvested Performance Units that would have vested as of such vesting date, nor will it entitle Participant to any compensation for the lost vesting. The Administrator shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when Participant is no longer actively providing services for purposes of the Performance Units grant (including whether Participant may still be considered to be providing services while on a leave of absence).

By Participant's signature and the signature of the representative of Elastic N.V. (the 'Company') below, Participant and the Company agree that this Award of Performance Units is granted under and governed by the terms and conditions of the Plan and this Award Agreement, including the Performance Goal attached hereto as Schedule I, the Terms and Conditions of Performance Unit Grant  and  the  Country  Addendum,  attached  hereto  as  Exhibit  A,  all  of  which  are  made  a  part  of  this  document.  Participant acknowledges receipt of a copy of the Plan. Participant has reviewed the Plan and this Award Agreement in their entirety, has had an opportunity to obtain the advice of counsel prior to executing this Award Agreement, and fully understands all provisions of the Plan and this Award Agreement. Participant hereby agrees to accept as binding, conclusive, and final all decisions or interpretations of the Administrator upon any questions relating to the Plan and the Award Agreement. Participant further agrees to notify the Company upon any change in the residence address indicated below.

By accepting this Award Agreement, Participant expressly consents to the sale of Shares to cover the Tax Withholding Obligations (as defined in the Terms and Conditions of Performance Unit Grant) arising from the Performance Units and any  associated  broker  or  other  fees  and  agrees  and  acknowledges  that,  subject  to Applicable  Laws,  Participant  may  not satisfy them by any means other than such sale of Shares, unless required to do so by the Administrator or pursuant to the Administrator's express written consent.

If this Award Agreement is not executed by Participant prior to the date that any Performance Units subject to this Award Agreement become vested, the Company will deem Participant to have accepted all of the terms and conditions of the Plan and this Award Agreement as of such vesting date.

## Performance Goal

| Level of Attainment vs. Plan   | Performance Goal Attainment (in $M)   | Percentage of Eligible Performance Units   |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Below Threshold:               |                                       |                                            |

If Performance Goal Attainment is greater than the 'Threshold' level and is between two points set forth above, then the Percentage of Eligible Performance Units shall be determined by linear interpolation, rounded to the nearest whole percentage. The number of Eligible Performance Units shall be determined by multiplying the Number of Performance Units indicated in the Notice of Grant by the applicable whole percentage. The product shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number of Performance Units.

## EXHIBIT A

## TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF PERFORMANCE UNIT GRANT

1. Grant of Performance Units. The Company hereby grants to the individual (the 'Participant') named in the Notice of Performance Unit Grant that forms part of this Award Agreement (the 'Notice of Grant') under the Plan an Award of Performance Units, subject to all of the terms and conditions in this Award Agreement and the Plan, which is incorporated herein by reference. Subject to Section 17 of the Plan, in the event of a conflict between the terms and conditions of the Plan and this Award Agreement, the terms and conditions of the Plan shall prevail.
2. Company's Obligation to Pay. Each Performance Unit represents the right to receive a Share on the date it vests. Unless and until the Performance Units will have vested in the manner set forth in Section 3 or 4, Participant will have no right to payment of any such Performance Units. Prior to actual payment of any vested Performance Units, such Performance Unit will represent an unsecured obligation of the Company, payable (if at all) only from the general assets of the Company.
3. Vesting Schedule. Except as provided in Section 4, and subject to Section 5, the Performance Units awarded by this Award Agreement will vest in accordance with the vesting schedule set forth in the Notice of Grant, subject to Participant remaining in Continuous Service Status through each applicable vesting date, with Continuous Service Status determined as described in the Notice of Grant.

## 4. Payment after Vesting.

- (a) General Rule. Subject to Section 8, any Performance Units that vest will be paid to Participant (or in the event of Participant's death, to his or her properly designated beneficiary or estate) in whole Shares. Subject to the provisions of Section 4(b), such vested Performance Units shall be paid in whole Shares as soon as practicable after vesting, but in each such case within sixty (60) days following the vesting date. In no event will Participant be permitted, directly or indirectly, to specify the taxable year of payment of any Performance Units payable under this Award Agreement.

## (b) Acceleration.

- (i) Discretionary  Acceleration.  The  Administrator,  in  its  discretion,  may  accelerate  the  vesting  of  the balance, or some lesser portion of the balance, of the unvested Performance Units at any time, subject to the terms of the Plan. If so accelerated, such Performance Units will be considered as having vested as of the date specified by the Administrator. If Participant is subject to taxation in the U.S., the payment of Shares vesting pursuant to this Section 4(b) shall in all cases be paid at a time or in a  manner that is  exempt from, or complies with, Section 409A. The prior sentence may be superseded in a future agreement or amendment to this Award Agreement only by direct and specific reference to such sentence.
- (ii) Notwithstanding  anything  in  the  Plan  or  this  Award  Agreement  or  any  other  agreement  (whether entered  into  before,  on  or  after  the  Date  of  Grant),  if  the  vesting  of  the  balance,  or  some  lesser  portion  of  the  balance,  of  the Performance Units is accelerated in connection with the termination of Participant's Continuous Service Status (provided that such termination is a 'separation from service' within the meaning of Section 409A, as determined by the Company), other than due to Participant's death, and if (x) Participant is subject to taxation in the U.S. and a 'specified employee' within the meaning of Section 409A at the time of such termination of

Continuous Service Status and (y) the payment of such accelerated Performance Units will result in the imposition of additional tax under Section 409A if paid to Participant on or within the six (6) month period following the termination of Participant's Continuous Service Status, then the payment of such accelerated Performance Units will not be made until the date six (6) months and one (1) day following the date of termination of Participant's Continuous Service Status, unless Participant dies following the termination of his or her Continuous Service Status, in which case, the Performance Units will be paid in Shares to Participant's estate as soon as practicable following his or her death.

- (c) Section  409A.  It  is  the  intent  of  this  Award  Agreement  that  it  and  all  payments  and  benefits  to  U.S.  taxpayers hereunder be exempt from, or comply with, the requirements of Section 409A so that none of the Performance Units provided under this Award Agreement or Shares issuable thereunder will be subject to the additional tax imposed under Section 409A, and any ambiguities herein will be interpreted to be so exempt or so comply. Each payment payable under this Award Agreement is intended to  constitute  a  separate  payment  for  purposes  of  Treasury  Regulation  Section  1.409A-2(b)(2).  However,  in  no  event  will  the Company reimburse Participant, or be otherwise responsible for, any taxes or costs that may be imposed on Participant as a result of Section 409A. For purposes of this Award Agreement, 'Section 409A' means Section 409A of the Code, and any final Treasury Regulations and Internal Revenue Service guidance thereunder, as each may be amended from time to time.
5. Forfeiture  Upon Termination of Continuous Service Status. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Award Agreement, if Participant's Continuous Service Status ceases for any or no reason, the then-unvested Performance Units awarded by this Award Agreement will thereupon be forfeited at no cost to the Company and Participant will have no further rights thereunder. The date that Continuous Service Status terminates will be determined as described in the Notice of Grant.
6. Tax Consequences. Participant has reviewed with his or her own tax advisors the U.S. and non-U.S. federal, state, and local tax consequences of this investment and the transactions contemplated by this Award Agreement. With respect to such matters, Participant relies solely on such advisors and not on any statements or representations of the Company or any of its agents, written or oral. Participant understands that Participant (and not the Company) shall be responsible for Participant's own tax liability that may arise as a result of this investment or the transactions contemplated by this Award Agreement.
7. Death  of  Participant. Any  distribution  or  delivery  to  be  made  to  Participant  under  this Award Agreement  will,  if Participant  is  then  deceased,  be  made  to  Participant's  designated  beneficiary,  provided  the  beneficiary  designation  is  valid  under Applicable  Laws  and  permitted  by  the  Company  for  Participant's  jurisdiction,  or  if  no  beneficiary  survives  Participant,  the administrator or executor of Participant's estate. Any such transferee must furnish the Company with (a) written notice of his or her status as transferee, and (b) evidence satisfactory to the Company to establish the validity of the transfer and compliance with any laws or regulations pertaining to said transfer.

## 8. Tax Obligations

- (a) Responsibility  for  Taxes.  Participant  acknowledges  that,  regardless  of  any  action  taken  by  the  Company  or,  if different, the Affiliate, Parent or Subsidiary to which Participant is providing services (the 'Service Recipient'), the ultimate liability for  any  tax  and/or  social  insurance  liability  obligations  and  requirements  in  connection  with  the  Performance  Units,  including, without  limitation,  (i)  all  U.S.  and  non-U.S.  federal,  state,  and  local  taxes  (including  Participant's  U.S.  Federal  Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) obligation) that are required to be withheld by the Company or the Service Recipient or other payment of tax-related items related to Participant's participation in the Plan and legally applicable to Participant, (ii) Participant's and, to the extent

required  by  the  Company  (or  Service  Recipient),  the  Company's  (or  Service  Recipient's)  fringe  benefit  tax  liability,  if  any, associated with the grant, vesting, or settlement of the Performance Units or sale of Shares, and (iii) any other Company (or Service Recipient)  taxes  the  responsibility  for  which  Participant  has,  or  has  agreed  to  bear,  with  respect  to  the  Performance  Units  (or settlement thereof or issuance of Shares thereunder) (collectively, the 'Tax Obligations'), is and remains Participant's responsibility and may exceed the amount, if any, actually withheld by the Company or the Service Recipient. Participant further acknowledges that  the  Company  and/or  the  Service  Recipient  (A)  make  no  representations  or  undertakings  regarding  the  treatment  of  any Tax Obligations in connection with any aspect of the Performance Units, including, but not limited to, the grant, vesting or settlement of the Performance Units, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such settlement and the receipt of any dividends or other distributions,  and  (B)  do  not  commit  to  and  are  under  no  obligation  to  structure  the  terms  of  the  grant  or  any  aspect  of  the Performance Units to reduce or eliminate Participant's liability for Tax Obligations or achieve any particular tax result. Further, if Participant  is  subject  to  Tax  Obligations  in  more  than  one  jurisdiction,  Participant  acknowledges  that  the  Company  and/or  the Service Recipient (or former service recipient, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax Obligations in more than  one  jurisdiction.  If  Participant  fails  to  make  satisfactory  arrangements  for  the  payment  of  any  required  Tax  Obligations hereunder at the time of the applicable taxable event, Participant acknowledges and agrees that the Company may refuse to issue or deliver the Shares.

(b) Tax Withholding  and  Default  Sell-to-Cover  Method  of  Tax  Withholding.  When  Shares  are  issued  as  payment  for vested Performance Units, Participant generally will recognize immediate U.S. taxable income if Participant is subject to taxation in the U.S. If Participant is subject to taxation in any other jurisdiction, Participant will be subject to applicable taxes, if any, in such jurisdiction at the time of the taxable event, as determined under local law. Subject to Section 8(c) and Applicable Laws, the amount of Tax Obligations which the Company determines must be withheld with respect to this Award ('Tax Withholding Obligation') will be  satisfied  by  Shares  being  sold  on  Participant's  behalf  at  the  prevailing  market  price  pursuant  to  such  procedures  as  the Administrator may specify from time to time, including through a broker-assisted arrangement (it being understood that the Shares to  be  sold  must  have  vested  pursuant  to  the  terms  of  this  Award  Agreement  and  the  Plan)  (the  'Sell-to-Cover  Method').  The proceeds from the Sell-to-Cover Method will be used to satisfy Participant's Tax Withholding Obligation arising with respect to this Award. In addition to Shares sold to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation, additional Shares will be sold to satisfy any associated broker or other fees. Only whole Shares will be sold through the Sell-to-Cover Method to satisfy any Tax Withholding Obligation and any associated broker or other fees. Any proceeds from the sale of Shares in excess of the Tax Withholding Obligation and any associated broker or other fees generated through the Sell-to-Cover Method will be paid to Participant in accordance with procedures the Company may specify from time to time. By accepting this Award, Participant expressly consents to the sale of Shares to cover  the  Tax  Withholding  Obligations  (and  any  associated  broker  or  other  fees)  through  the  Sell-to-Cover  Method  and agrees and acknowledges that, subject to Applicable Laws, Participant may not satisfy them by any means other than such sale of Shares, unless required to do so by the Administrator or pursuant to the Administrator's express written consent.

(c) Administrator Discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing Sections 8(a) and 8(b), if the Administrator determines it is in  the  best  interests  of  the  Company  for  Participant  to  satisfy  Participant's  Tax  Withholding  Obligation  by  a  method  other  than through the default Sell-to-Cover Method described in Section 8(b), it may permit or require Participant to satisfy Participant's Tax Withholding  Obligation,  in  whole  or  in  part  (without  limitation),  if  permissible  by  Applicable  Laws,  by  (i)  paying  cash,  (ii) withholding the amount of such Tax Withholding Obligation from Participant's wages or other cash compensation paid to Participant by  the  Company  and/or  the  Service  Recipient,  (iii)  if  Participant  is  a  U.S.  employee,  delivering  to  the  Company  Shares  that Participant owns and that have vested with a fair market value equal to the amount required to be withheld (or such other amount, up to the maximum withholding rate in Participant's country,

determined by the Administrator and provided such other amount would not result in adverse financial accounting consequences to the Company as determined by the Administrator), (iv) by having the Company withhold otherwise deliverable Shares having a fair market  value  equal  to  the  amount  required  to  be  withheld  (or  such  other  amount,  up  to  the  maximum  withholding  rate  in Participant's  country,  determined  by  the  Administrator  and  provided  such  other  amount  would  not  result  in  adverse  financial accounting consequences to the Company as determined by the Administrator), and, unless the Administrator provides otherwise, this will be the default method for satisfying Participant's Tax Withholding Obligations if Participant has not executed this Award Agreement or otherwise failed to take actions necessary to facilitate the Sell-to-Cover Method prior to the date that any Performance Units under this Award Agreement become vested, or (v) such other means as the Administrator deems appropriate.

- (d) Company's Obligation to Deliver Shares. For clarification purposes, in no event will the Company issue Participant any Shares unless and until arrangements satisfactory to the Administrator have been made for the payment of Participant's Tax Withholding Obligation. If Participant fails to make satisfactory arrangements for the payment of such Tax Withholding Obligations hereunder at the time any applicable Performance Units otherwise are scheduled to vest pursuant to Sections 3 or 4 or Participant's Tax  Withholding  Obligations  otherwise  become  due,  Participant  will  permanently  forfeit  such  Performance  Units  to  which Participant's Tax Withholding Obligation relates and any right to receive Shares thereunder and such Performance Units will be returned to the Company at no cost to the Company. Participant acknowledges and agrees that the Company may refuse to issue or deliver the Shares if such Tax Obligations are not delivered at the time they are due.
9. Rights as Shareholder. Neither Participant nor any person claiming under or through Participant will have any of the rights or privileges of a shareholder of the Company in respect of any Shares deliverable hereunder unless and until such Shares (which  are  in  book  entry  form)  will  have  been  issued  and  delivered  to  Participant  (including  through  electronic  delivery  to  a brokerage account). Such issuance will occur by the execution of a deed of issuance to which the Company and Participant are each party, unless the Shares will be delivered into a brokerage account in the name of Participant, in which case the issuance will take place by a deed of issuance with due observance of the relevant requirements that may apply from time to time. After such issuance and delivery, Participant will have all the rights of a shareholder of the Company with respect to voting such Shares and receipt of dividends and distributions on such Shares.
10. No Guarantee of Continued Service. PARTICIPANT ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THE VESTING OF THE PERFORMANCE UNITS PURSUANT TO THE VESTING SCHEDULE HEREOF IS EARNED ONLY BY REMAINING IN CONTINUOUS SERVICE STATUS, WHICH UNLESS PROVIDED OTHERWISE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW IS AT THE WILL OF THE COMPANY (OR THE SERVICE RECIPIENT) AND NOT THROUGH THE ACT OF BEING HIRED, BEING GRANTED  THIS  PERFORMANCE  UNIT  AWARD  OR  ACQUIRING  SHARES  HEREUNDER.  PARTICIPANT  FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES  AND  AGREES  THAT  THIS  AWARD  AGREEMENT,  THE  TRANSACTIONS  CONTEMPLATED HEREUNDER AND THE VESTING SCHEDULE SET FORTH HEREIN DO NOT CONSTITUTE AN EXPRESS OR IMPLIED PROMISE OF CONTINUED ENGAGEMENT AS AN EMPLOYEE OR CONSULTANT FOR THE VESTING PERIOD, FOR ANY PERIOD, OR AT ALL, AND SHALL NOT INTERFERE IN ANY WAY WITH PARTICIPANT'S RIGHT OR THE RIGHT OF THE COMPANY (OR THE SERVICE RECIPIENT) TO TERMINATE PARTICIPANT'S CONTINUOUS SERVICE STATUS, SUBJECT  TO  APPLICABLE  LAW,  WHICH  TERMINATION,  UNLESS  PROVIDED  OTHERWISE  UNDER  APPLICABLE LAW, MAY BE AT ANY TIME, WITH OR WITHOUT CAUSE.

11. Grant is Not Transferable. Except to the limited extent provided in Section 7, this grant and the rights and privileges conferred hereby will not be transferred, assigned, pledged or hypothecated in any way (whether by operation of law or otherwise) and  will  not  be  subject  to  sale  under  execution,  attachment  or  similar  process.  Upon  any  attempt  to  transfer,  assign,  pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of this grant, or any right or privilege conferred hereby, or upon any attempted sale under any execution, attachment or similar process, this grant and the rights and privileges conferred hereby immediately will become null and void.
12. Nature of Grant. In accepting the grant, Participant acknowledges, understands, and agrees that:
3. (a) the Plan is established voluntarily by the Company, it is discretionary in nature and it may be modified, amended, suspended or terminated by the Company at any time, to the extent permitted by the Plan;
4. (b) the grant of the Performance Units is exceptional, voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future grants of Performance Units, or benefits in lieu of Performance Units, even if Performance Units have been granted in the past;
5. (c) all  decisions  with  respect  to  future  Performance  Units  or  other  grants,  if  any,  will  be  at  the  sole  discretion  of  the Company;
6. (d) the grant of the Performance Units and Participant's participation in the Plan shall not create a right to employment, other  service  relationship,  or  be  interpreted  as  forming  or  amending  an  employment  or  service  contract  with  the  Company,  the Service Recipient or any other Affiliate, Parent or Subsidiary, and shall not interfere with the ability of the Company, the Service Recipient  or  any  other  Affiliate,  Parent  or  Subsidiary,  as  applicable,  to  terminate  Participant's  employment  or  other  service relationship, if any;
7. (e) Participant is voluntarily participating in the Plan;

10. (h) unless  otherwise  agreed  in  writing  with  the  Company,  the  Performance  Units  and  the  Shares  subject  to  the Performance Units, and the income from and value of same, are not granted as consideration for, or in connection with, the service Participant may provide as a director of an Affiliate, Parent or Subsidiary;
11. (i) the future value of the underlying Shares is unknown, indeterminable and cannot be predicted with certainty;
12. (j) no  claim  or  entitlement  to  compensation  or  damages  shall  arise  from  forfeiture  of  the  Performance  Units  or  any underlying Shares resulting from (i) the application of any compensation recovery or clawback policy adopted by the Company or required by law, or (ii) the termination of Participant's Continuous Service Status (for any reason whatsoever whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where Participant is employed or providing services or the terms of Participant's employment or service agreement, if any);

(k) unless otherwise provided in the Plan or by the Company in its discretion, the Performance Units and the benefits evidenced by this Award Agreement do not create any entitlement to have the Performance Units or any such benefits transferred to, or  assumed  by,  another  company  nor  be  exchanged,  cashed  out  or  substituted  for,  in  connection  with  any  corporate  transaction affecting the Shares; and

- (l) neither  the  Company nor the Service Recipient or any other Affiliate, Parent or Subsidiary shall be liable for any foreign exchange rate fluctuation between Participant's local currency and the United States Dollar that may affect the value of the Performance Units or of any amounts due to Participant pursuant to the settlement of the Performance Units or the subsequent sale of any Shares acquired upon settlement.
13. No Advice Regarding Grant. The Company is not providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor is the Company making any recommendations regarding Participant's participation in the Plan, or Participant's acquisition or sale of the underlying Shares. Participant is hereby advised to consult with his or her own personal tax, legal and financial advisors regarding his or her participation in the Plan before taking any action related to the Plan.
14. Data  Privacy.  Participant  hereby  explicitly  and  unambiguously  consents  to  the  collection,  use  and  transfer,  in electronic or other form, of Participant's personal data as described in this Award Agreement and any other Performance Unit grant materials by and among, as applicable, the Service Recipient, the Company and any other Affiliate, Parent or Subsidiary for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing Participant's participation in the Plan.

Participant  understands  that  the  Company  and  the  Service  Recipient  may  hold  certain  personal  information  about Participant, including, but not limited to, Participant's name, home address and telephone number, email address, date of birth, social insurance number (to the extent permitted under Applicable Laws), passport or other identification number (e.g., resident registration number), salary, nationality, job title, any Shares or directorships held in the Company, details of all Performance Units  or  any  other  entitlement  to  Shares  or  equivalent  benefits  awarded,  canceled,  purchased,  exercised,  vested,  unvested  or outstanding in Participant's favor ('Data'), for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Plan.

Participant  understands  that  Data  will  be  transferred  to  such  stock  plan  service  provider(s)  as  may  be  selected  by  the Company (currently  Morgan  Stanley  Smith  Barney  LLC,  the  brokerage  firm  engaged  by  the  Company  to  hold  participants' Shares and other amounts acquired under the Plan, and its affiliated companies (collectively, 'the Designated Broker')) to assist with  the  implementation,  administration,  and  management  of  the  Plan.  The  recipients  of  Data  may  be  located  in  the  United States or elsewhere, and each recipient's country of operation (e.g., the United States) may have different data privacy laws and protections than Participant's country. Depending on where Participant is based, such rights may include the right to request a list  with  the  names  and  addresses  of  any  potential  recipients  of  Data  by  contacting  his  or  her  local  human  resources representative.  Participant  authorizes  the  Company,  any  stock  plan  service  provider  selected  by  the  Company  and  any  other possible recipients which may assist the Company (presently or in the future) with implementing, administering and managing the Plan to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer Data, in electronic or other form, for the sole purpose of implementing, administering  and  managing  his  or  her  participation  in  the  Plan,  including  any  requisite  transfer  of  such  Data  as  may  be required to a broker, escrow agent or other third party with whom Participant may elect to deposit any Shares received upon vesting  of  the  Performance  Units.  Participant  understands  that  Data  will  be  held  only  as  long  as  is  necessary  to  implement, administer and manage Participant's participation in the Plan. Participant may have a number of rights under data privacy laws in Participant's jurisdiction. Depending on where Participant is based, such rights may include the right to, at any time, view Data, request information about the

storage and processing of Data, require any necessary amendments to Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein, in any case without cost, by contacting his or her local human resources representative. Further, Participant understands that he or she is  providing  the  consents  herein  on  a  purely  voluntary  basis.  If  Participant  does  not  consent,  or  if  Participant  later  seeks  to revoke his or her consent, his or her employment or service with the Service Recipient will not be affected; the only consequence of refusing or withdrawing Participant's consent is that the Company would not be able to grant Participant Performance Units or other equity awards or administer or maintain such awards. Therefore, Participant understands that refusing or withdrawing his  or  her  consent  may  affect  Participant's  ability  to  participate  in  the  Plan.  For  more  information  on  the  consequences  of Participant's  refusal  to  consent  or  withdrawal  of  consent,  Participant  may  contact  his  or  her  local  human  resources representative.

Finally, Participant understands that the Company may rely on a different basis for the processing or transfer of Data in the  future  and/or  request  that  Participant  provide  another  data  privacy  consent.  If  applicable,  Participant  agrees  that  upon request of the Company or the Service Recipient, Participant will provide an executed acknowledgement or data privacy consent form (or any other agreements or consents) that the Company and/or the Service Recipient may deem necessary to obtain from Participant for the purpose of administering Participant's participation in the Plan in compliance with the data privacy laws in Participant's country, either now or in the future. Participant understands and agrees that he or she will not be able to participate in the Plan if he or she fails to provide any such consent or agreement requested by the Company and/or the Service Recipient.

Any  notice  to  be  given  to  the  Company  under  the  terms  of  this  Award Agreement  will  be addressed to the Company at Elastic N.V., 88 Kearny St. Floor 19, San Francisco, California 94108 or at such other address as the Company may hereafter designate in writing.

Either party's failure to enforce any provision or provisions of this Award Agreement shall not in any way be construed as a waiver of any such provision or provisions, nor prevent that party from thereafter enforcing each and every other provision of this Award Agreement. The rights granted both parties herein are cumulative and shall not constitute a waiver of either party's right to assert all other legal remedies available to it under the circumstances.
18. Successors and Assigns. The Company may assign any of its rights under this Award Agreement to single or multiple assignees,  and  this  Award  Agreement  shall  inure  to  the  benefit  of  the  successors  and  assigns  of  the  Company.

The rights and obligations of Participant under this Award Agreement may only be assigned with the prior written consent of the Company.
19. Additional Conditions to Issuance of Shares. If at any time the Company determines, in its discretion, that the listing, registration, qualification or rule compliance of the Shares upon any securities exchange or under any U.S. or non-U.S. state, federal or local law, including exchange control, tax or other Applicable Laws or related regulations, or under the rulings or regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission or any other U.S. or non-U.S. governmental

-8- regulatory body or the clearance, consent or approval of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission or any other U.S. or non-U.S. governmental regulatory authority is necessary or desirable as a condition to the issuance of Shares to Participant (or his or her  estate)  hereunder,  such  issuance  will  not  occur  unless  and  until  such  listing,  registration,  qualification,  rule  compliance, clearance,  consent  or  approval  has  been  completed,  effected  or  obtained  free  of  any  conditions  not  acceptable  to  the  Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Participant understands that the Company is under no obligation to register, qualify or otherwise obtain clearance, consent or other approvals from any governmental authority or any stock exchange. Subject to the terms of the Award Agreement and the Plan, the Company shall not be required to issue any certificate or certificates for Shares hereunder prior to  the  lapse  of  such  reasonable  period  of  time  following  the  date  of  vesting  of  the  Performance  Units  as  the Administrator  may establish from time to time for reasons of administrative convenience.

20. Language.  Participant  acknowledges  and  represents  that  he  or  she  is  proficient  in  the  English  language  or  has consulted with an advisor who is sufficiently proficient in English, as to allow Participant to understand the terms of this Award Agreement and any other documents related to the Plan. If Participant has received this Award Agreement or any other document related to the Plan translated into a language other than English and if the meaning of the translated version is different than the English version, the English version will control.
21. Interpretation. The Administrator will have the power to interpret the Plan and this Award Agreement and to adopt such rules for the administration, interpretation and application of the Plan as are consistent therewith and to interpret or revoke any such rules (including, but not limited to, the determination of whether or not any Performance Units have vested). All actions taken and all interpretations and determinations made by the Administrator in good faith will be final and binding upon Participant, the Company and all other interested persons. Neither the Administrator nor any person acting on behalf of the Administrator will be personally  liable  for  any  action,  determination,  or  interpretation  made  in  good  faith  with  respect  to  the  Plan  or  this  Award Agreement.
22. Captions.  Captions  provided  herein  are  for  convenience  only  and  are  not  to  serve  as  a  basis  for  interpretation  or construction of this Award Agreement.
23. Amendment, Suspension or Termination of the Plan. By accepting this Award, Participant expressly warrants that he or she has received an Award of Performance Units under the Plan, and has received, read, and understood a description of the Plan. Participant understands that the Plan is discretionary in nature and may be amended, suspended or terminated by the Company at any time.
24. Modifications to the Award Agreement. This Award Agreement constitutes the entire understanding of the parties on the  subjects  covered.  Participant  expressly  warrants  that  he  or  she  is  not  accepting  this  Award  Agreement  in  reliance  on  any promises, representations, or inducements other than those contained herein. Modifications to this Award Agreement or the Plan can be made only in an express written contract executed by a duly authorized officer of the Company. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary  in  the  Plan  or  this  Award  Agreement,  the  Company  reserves  the  right  to  impose  other  requirements  on  Participant's participation in the Plan, on the Performance Units and on any Shares acquired under the Plan, to the extent the Company determines it  is  necessary  or  advisable  for  legal  or  administrative  reasons,  and  to  require  Participant  to  sign  any  additional  agreements  or undertakings  that  may  be  necessary  to  accomplish  the  foregoing.  Further,  the  Company  reserves  the  right  to  revise  this Award Agreement as it deems necessary or advisable, in its sole discretion and without the consent of Participant, to comply with Section 409A or to otherwise  avoid  imposition  of  any  additional  tax  or  income  recognition  under  Section  409A  in  connection  with  this Award of Performance Units.

25. Governing Law; Venue; Severability. This Award Agreement and the Performance Units are governed by the internal substantive laws, but not the choice of law rules, of Delaware; provided, however, that the corporate law aspects of issuance shall be governed by the laws of the Netherlands. For purposes of litigating any dispute that arises under these Performance Units or this Award Agreement, the parties hereby submit to and consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the State of California, and agree that such litigation will be conducted in the courts of Santa Clara County, California, or the United States federal courts for the Northern District  of  California,  and  no  other  courts,  where  this Award Agreement  is  made  and/or  to  be  performed.  In  the  event  that  any provision  hereof  becomes  or  is  declared  by  a  court  of  competent  jurisdiction  to  be  illegal,  unenforceable  or  void,  this  Award Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
26. Entire Agreement. The Plan is incorporated herein by reference. The Plan and this Award Agreement (including the appendices and exhibits referenced herein) constitute the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede in their entirety all prior undertakings and agreements of the Company and Participant with respect to the subject matter hereof, and, subject to Section 24 hereof, may not be modified adversely to Participant's interest except by means of a writing signed by the Company and Participant.
27. Country Addendum. Notwithstanding any provisions in this Award Agreement, the Performance Unit grant shall be subject  to  any  special  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  an  appendix  to  this Award Agreement  for  any  country  whose  laws  are applicable  to  Participant  and  this  Award  of  Performance  Units  (as  determined  by  the  Administrator  in  its  sole  discretion)  (the 'Country Addendum'). Moreover, if Participant relocates to one of the countries included in the Country Addendum, the special terms and conditions for such country will apply to Participant, to the extent the Company determines that the application of such terms and conditions is necessary or advisable for legal or administrative reasons. The Country Addendum constitutes part of this Award Agreement.
28. Insider Trading/Market Abuse Laws. Participant may be subject to insider trading restrictions and/or market abuse laws in applicable jurisdictions,  including  the  United  States  and,  if  different,  Participant's  country,  Participant's  broker's  country and/or the country in which Shares may be listed, if applicable, which may affect Participant's ability to accept or otherwise acquire, or sell, attempt to sell or otherwise dispose of, Shares or rights to Shares (e.g., Performance Units) under the Plan or rights linked to the  value  of  Shares  (e.g.,  phantom  awards,  futures)  during  such  times  as  Participant  is  considered  to  have  'inside  information' regarding the Company (as defined by the laws or regulations in the applicable jurisdiction) or the trade in Shares or the trade in rights to Shares under the Plan. Local insider trading laws and regulations may prohibit the cancellation or amendment of orders Participant placed before possessing inside information. Furthermore, Participant could be prohibited from (1) disclosing the inside information to any third party and (2) 'tipping' third parties or otherwise causing them to buy or sell Company securities; 'third parties' includes fellow employees or service providers. Any restrictions under these laws or regulations are separate from and in addition  to  any  restrictions  that  may  be  imposed  under  any  applicable  company  insider  trading  policy.  It  is  Participant's responsibility to comply with any applicable restrictions and Participant should speak to a personal advisor on this matter.
29. Foreign Asset/Account Reporting Requirements And Exchange Controls. Certain foreign asset and/or foreign account reporting requirements and exchange controls may affect Participant's ability to acquire or hold Shares acquired under the Plan or cash received from participating in the Plan (including from any dividends paid on or sales proceeds arising from the sale of Shares acquired under the plan) in a brokerage or bank account outside Participant's country of residence. Participant may be required to report such accounts, assets or transactions to the tax or other authorities in Participant's country and/or to repatriate sale proceeds or other funds received as a result of participation in the Plan to Participant's country through a designated bank or broker

within a certain time after receipt. It is Participant's responsibility to be aware of and comply with such regulations, and Participant should consult a personal legal advisor for any details.

## ELASTIC N.V.

## AMENDED AND RESTATED 2012 STOCK OPTION PLAN PERFORMANCE UNIT AGREEMENT COUNTRY ADDENDUM

Capitalized  terms  used  but  not  otherwise  defined  herein  shall  have  the  meaning  given  to  such  terms  in  the  Plan,  the  Notice  of Performance Unit Grant or the Terms and Conditions of Performance Unit Grant, as applicable.

## Terms and Conditions

This Country Addendum includes additional terms and conditions that govern the Award of Performance Units granted to Participant under the Plan if Participant resides and/or works in one of the countries listed below. If Participant is a citizen or resident of a jurisdiction (or is considered as such for local law purposes) other than the one(s) in which he or she is currently residing and/or working or if Participant relocates to another jurisdiction after receiving the Award of Performance Units, the Company will, in its sole discretion, determine the extent to which the terms and conditions contained herein will be applicable to Participant.

## Notifications

This Country Addendum also includes notifications relating to exchange control and certain other issues of which Participant should be aware with respect to his or her participation in the Plan. The information is based on the exchange control, securities and other laws in effect in the respective countries listed in this Country Addendum, as of \_\_\_\_\_\_. Such laws are often complex and change frequently. As a result, Participant should not rely on the notifications in this Country Addendum as the only source of information relating to the consequences of his or her participation in the Plan because the information may be out of date at the time Participant vests in the Performance Units and acquires Shares, or when Participant subsequently sell Shares acquired under the Plan.

In addition, the notifications herein are general in nature and may not apply to Participant's particular situation, and the Company is not in a position to assure Participant of any particular result. Accordingly, Participant is advised to seek appropriate professional advice as to how the relevant laws in Participant's jurisdiction may apply to Participant's situation.

Finally, if Participant is a citizen or resident of a jurisdiction other than the one(s) in which Participant is currently residing and/or working or if Participant moves to another jurisdiction after receiving the Award of Performance Units, the information contained herein may not be applicable to Participant in the same manner.

## EUROPEAN  UNION  ('EU')/EUROPEAN  ECONOMIC  AREA  ('EEA')  COUNTRIES,  SWITZERLAND  AND  THE UNITED KINGDOM (TOGETHER, 'EEA+')

## Terms and Conditions

Data Privacy. This provision replaces Section 14 of the Terms and Conditions of Performance Unit Grant:

- (a) Controller.  The  Company  is  the  controller  responsible  for  processing  Participant's  Data  (as  defined  below)  in connection with this Award Agreement.
- (b) Purposes  and  Legal  Bases  of  Processing.  The  Company  processes  Data  (as  defined  below)  for  the  purpose  of performing its contractual obligations under this Award Agreement, granting Performance Units, implementing, administering and managing Participant's participation in the Plan and facilitating compliance with Applicable Laws. The legal basis for the processing of Data (as defined below) by the Company and the third-party service providers described below is (i) the necessity of the data processing for the Company to perform its contractual obligations under this Award Agreement with Participant, (ii) the necessity for compliance with legal obligations to which the Company is subject, and (iii) the Company's legitimate business interest of managing the Plan and generally administering the Award.
- (c) Data Collection and Usage. The Company and the Service Recipient will collect, process and use certain personal information about Participant, including, but not limited to, Participant's name, home address and telephone number, email address, date  of  birth,  tax  and  social  insurance,  passport  or  other  identification  number,  salary,  nationality,  job  title,  any  Shares  or directorships held in the Company, details of all awards or any other entitlement to Shares or equivalent benefits awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in Participant's favor ('Data').
- (d) Stock Plan Administration Service Providers. The Company transfers Data to such independent stock plan service provider(s)  based  in  the  United  States  as  may  be  selected  by  the  Company  (currently  Morgan  Stanley  Smith  Barney,  LLC,  the brokerage firm engaged by the Company to hold participants' Shares and other amounts acquired under the Plan, and its affiliated companies  (collectively,  'the  Designated  Broker')),  which  assists  the  Company  with  the  implementation,  administration  and management of the Plan. Participant acknowledges and understands that the Designated Broker will open an account for Participant to receive and trade Shares acquired under the Plan and that Participant will be asked to agree on separate terms and data processing practices with the Designated Broker, with such agreement being a condition to the ability to participate in the Plan.
- (e) International Data Transfers. The Company is based in the Netherlands and the United States. The Designated Broker is  based  in  the  United  States.  Participant's  country  or  jurisdiction  may  have  different  data  privacy  laws  and  protections  than  the Netherlands and/or the United States. The Company has implemented appropriate safeguards for protecting Data that it receives in the United States through its adherence to EU Standard Contractual Clauses entered into between the Company and any Affiliate, Parent  or  Subsidiary  within  the  EEA+.  Participant  may  request  a  copy  of  the  EU  Standard  Contractual  Clauses  by  contacting privacy@elastic.co. No appropriate safeguards have been implemented with respect to the onward transfer by the Company to the Designated Broker. Instead, the onward transfer is solely based on the necessity of the onward transfer for the performance of the Company's contractual obligations under this Award Agreement. Participant understands that this might result in certain risks to his or  her  Data  such  as  the  lack  of  protection  by  substantive  data  processing  principles,  the  lack  of  supervision  by  data  protection authorities, or the lack of enforceable rights regarding the processing of Participant's Data. The

current data privacy policy in place by the Designated Broker can be obtained via https://www.morganstanley.com/disclaimers/usprivacy-policy-and-notice. In addition, Participant may request further information, especially on the safeguards implemented for the onward transfer to the Designated Broker, by contacting cpo@etrade.com.

- (f) Data  Retention. The  Company  will  hold  and  use  Data  only  as  long  as  is  necessary  to  implement,  administer  and manage Participant's participation in the Plan, or as required to comply with legal or regulatory obligations, including under tax and securities laws. This means Data may be retained until after termination of Participant's Continuous Service Status.
- (g) Data Subject Rights. Participant may have a number of rights under data privacy laws in Participant's jurisdiction. Such rights may include the right to (i) request access or copies of Data the Company processes, (ii) rectification of incorrect Data, (iii) deletion of Data, (iv) restrictions on processing of Data, (v) object to the processing of Data for legitimate interests on grounds relating to Participants' particular situation, (vi) portability of Data, (vii) lodge complaints with competent authorities in Participant's jurisdiction,  and/or  (viii)  receive  a  list  with  the  names  and  addresses  of  any  potential  recipients  of  Data. To  receive  clarification regarding these rights or to exercise these rights, Participant can contact his or her local human resources representative.
- (h) Contractual  Requirement.  Participant's  provision  of  Data  and  its  processing  and  transfer  as  described  above  is  a contractual  requirement  and  a  condition  to  Participant's  ability  to  participate  in  the  Plan.  Participant  understands  that,  as  a consequence of Participant's refusing to provide Data, the Company may not be able to allow Participant to participate in the Plan, grant Performance Units to Grantee or administer or maintain such Performance Units. However, Participant's participation in the Plan and his or her acceptance of this Award Agreement are purely voluntary. While Participant will not receive Performance Units or other Awards if he or she decides against participating in the Plan or providing Data as described above, Participant's career and salary will not be affected in any way. For more information on the consequences of the refusal to provide Data, Participant may contact privacy@elastic.co.

## ELASTIC N.V.

## NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR COMPENSATION POLICY

(As adopted and approved on September 18, 2018; as amended June 5, 2024)

Elastic  N.V.  (the  ' Company ')  believes  that  providing  cash  and  equity  compensation  to  its  non-executive  directors  (the ' Non-Executive  Directors ')  represents  an  effective  tool  to  attract,  retain  and  reward  such  Non-Executive  Directors.  This  NonExecutive Director Compensation Policy (the ' Policy ') is intended to formalize the Company's policy regarding cash compensation and grants of equity awards to its Non-Executive Directors. Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms used in this Policy will have the meaning given such term in the Company's Amended and Restated 2012 Stock Option Plan (the ' Plan '). Each NonExecutive Director will be solely responsible for any tax obligations incurred by such Non-Executive Director as a result of the equity and cash payments such Non-Executive Director receives under this Policy.

This amended Policy will be effective as of June 5, 2024 (such date, the ' Effective Date ').

## 1. Cash Compensation

## Annual Cash Retainer

Each Non-Executive Director will be paid an annual cash retainer of US$ 35,000. There are no per-meeting attendance fees for  attending  meetings  of  the  Board  of  Directors  (the  ' Board ').  This  cash  compensation  will  be  paid  quarterly  in  arrears  on  a prorated basis.

## Committee Annual Cash Retainer

As of the Effective Date, each Non-Executive Director who serves as the lead independent director, or the chair or a member of a committee of the Board will be eligible to earn additional annual fees (paid quarterly in arrears on a prorated basis) as follows:

Lead Independent Director:            US$    20,000

Chairman of Audit Committee:            US$    25,000

Member of Audit Committee:            US$    10,000

Chairman of Compensation Committee:        US$    15,525

Member of Compensation Committee:        US$    8,000

Chairman of Nominating and Governance Committee:    US$    11,000

Member of Nominating and Governance Committee:    US$    5,000

## 2. Equity Compensation

Except as set forth below, a Non-Executive Director will be eligible to receive all types of Awards (except Incentive Stock Options) under the Plan (or the applicable equity plan in place at the time of grant), including discretionary Awards not covered under  this  Policy.  All  grants  of  Awards  to  such  eligible  Non-Executive  Directors  pursuant  to  Section  2  of  this  Policy  will  be automatic and nondiscretionary, except as otherwise provided herein, and will be made in accordance with the following provisions:

- (a)    No Discretion; Eligibility. Except as set forth in this Policy, no person will have any discretion to select which eligible Non-Executive Directors will be granted any Awards under this Policy or to determine the number of Shares to be covered by such Awards. A Non-Executive Director who either (i) beneficially owns more than 2% of the outstanding and issued share capital of the Company, or (ii) is a partner or a member of any venture capital firm that owns securities of the Company representing more than 2% of the outstanding and issued share capital of the Company, will not be eligible to receive Initial or Annual Awards under this Policy.
- (b)    Initial Awards. Each person who first becomes an eligible Non-Executive Director following the Effective Date will be granted  an  award  of  restricted  stock  units  (an  ' Initial  Award ')  covering  a  number  of  shares  having  a  grant  date  fair  value (determined  in  accordance  with  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles)  (the  ' Value ')  of  US$200,000  pro-rated  for  the amount  of  time  that  remains  in  the  12-month  period  prior  to  the  next  scheduled  annual  general  meeting  of  shareholders  of  the Company (the ' Annual General Meeting ') (and if the date of such Annual General Meeting is not known, the one-year anniversary of the most recent Annual Award granted to non-executive directors), rounded down to the nearest whole share. The Initial Award will be made on the first trading date on or after the date on which such individual first becomes an eligible Non-Executive Director, whether through election by the general meeting of shareholders of the Company or appointment by the Board to fill a vacancy. The shares underlying each Initial Award will vest on the earlier of (i) the one-year anniversary of the date the Initial Award is granted or (ii) the day prior to the date of the Annual General Meeting next following the date the Initial Award is granted, in each case subject to the eligible Non-Executive Director continuing to be a Non-Executive Director through the applicable vesting date. Each Initial Award will fully vest immediately prior to a Change in Control, subject to the eligible Non-Executive Director remaining a NonExecutive Director at the time of the Change in Control.
- (c)        Annual  Award.  On  the  date  of  each  Annual  General  Meeting,  each  eligible  Non-Executive  Director  will  be automatically granted an award of restricted stock units (an ' Annual Award ') covering a number of shares having a Value of US$ 200,000, rounded down to the nearest whole share. The shares underlying each Annual Award will vest on the earlier of (i) the oneyear  anniversary  of  the  date  the Annual Award  is  granted  or  (ii)  the  day  prior  to  the  date  of  the Annual  General  Meeting  next following the date the Annual Award is granted, in each case, subject to the eligible Non-Executive Director continuing to be a NonExecutive Director through the applicable vesting date. Each Annual Award will fully vest immediately prior to a

Change in Control, subject to the eligible Non-Executive Director remaining a Non-Executive Director at the time of the Change in Control.

## 3. Change in Control

In the event of a Change in Control, each eligible Non-Executive Director will fully vest in his or her outstanding Company equity awards, including any Initial Award or Annual Award, provided that the eligible Non-Executive Director continues to be a Non-Executive Director through such date.

## 4. Travel Expenses

Each  Non-Executive  Director's  reasonable,  customary  and  documented  travel  expenses  to  Board  meetings  will  be reimbursed by the Company.

## 5. Adjustments

In  the  event  that  any  dividend  or  other  distribution  (whether  in  the  form  of  cash,  shares,  other  securities  or  other  property), recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, repurchase, or exchange of shares or other securities  of  the  Company,  or  other  change  in  the  corporate  structure  of  the  Company  affecting  the shares  occurs,  the  administrator  of  the  Company's  amended  and  restated  2012  option  plan,  in  order  to  prevent  diminution  or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under this Policy, will adjust the number of shares issuable pursuant to awards granted under this Policy.

## 6. Section 409A

In no event will cash compensation or expense reimbursement payments under this Policy be paid after the later of (i) the 15th day of the 3rd month following the end of the Company's fiscal year in which the compensation is earned or expenses are incurred, as applicable, or (ii)  the  15th  day  of  the  3rd  month  following  the  end  of  the  calendar  year  in  which  the  compensation  is  earned  or expenses  are  incurred,  as  applicable,  in  compliance  with  the  'short-term  deferral'  exception  under  Section  409A  of  the  Internal Revenue Code of 1986,  as  amended,  and  the  final  regulations  and  guidance  thereunder,  as  may  be  amended  from  time  to  time (together, ' Section 409A '). It is the intent of this Policy that this Policy and all payments hereunder be exempt from or otherwise comply with the requirements of Section 409A so that none of the compensation to be provided hereunder will be subject to the additional tax imposed under Section 409A, and any ambiguities or ambiguous terms herein will be interpreted to be so exempt or comply. In no event will the Company reimburse a Non-Executive Director for any taxes imposed or other costs incurred as a result of Section 409A.

## 7. Revisions

The  Board  may  amend,  alter,  suspend  or  terminate  this  Policy  at  any  time  and  for  any  reason.  No  amendment,  alteration, suspension or termination of this Policy will materially

impair the rights of a Non-Executive Director with respect to compensation that already has been paid or awarded, unless otherwise mutually agreed between the Non-Executive Director and the Company.

## INTRODUCTION

Elastic N.V. (together with its subsidiaries, the ' Company ') opposes trading in securities of any entity while aware of material nonpublic information related to that entity, or providing without authorization such information to another to enable them to engage in such a transaction. Any such actions by persons covered by this Insider Trading Policy (the ' Policy '), will be deemed a violation of this Policy.

## Legal prohibitions on insider trading

The  antifraud  provisions  of  U.S.  federal  securities  laws  prohibit  directors,  officers,  employees  and  other  individuals  who  possess  material  nonpublic information  from  trading  on  the  basis  of  that  information.  Transactions  will  be  considered  'on  the  basis  of'  material  nonpublic  information  if  the  person engaged in the transaction was aware of the material nonpublic information at the time of the transaction. It is not a defense that the person did not 'use' the information for purposes of the transaction.

Disclosing material nonpublic information directly or indirectly to others who then trade based on that information or making recommendations or expressing opinions as to transactions in securities while aware of material nonpublic information (which is sometimes referred to as ' tipping ') is also illegal. Both the person who provides the information, recommendation or opinion and the person who trades based on it may be liable.

These illegal activities are commonly referred to as ' insider trading '. State securities laws and securities laws of other jurisdictions also impose restrictions on insider trading.

In addition, a company, as well as individual directors, officers and other supervisory personnel, may be subject to liability as 'controlling persons' for failure to take appropriate steps to prevent insider trading by those under their supervision, influence or control.

## Detection and prosecution of insider trading

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ' SEC '), securities exchanges and other regulators use sophisticated electronic surveillance techniques to investigate and detect insider trading, and the SEC and the U.S. Department of Justice pursue insider trading violations vigorously. Cases involving trading through foreign accounts, trading by family members and friends and trading involving only a small number of shares have been successfully prosecuted.

## Penalties for violation of insider trading laws and this Policy

Civil and criminal penalties. As of the effective date of this Policy, potential penalties for insider trading violations under U.S. federal securities laws include:

- damages in a private lawsuit;
- disgorging any profits made or losses avoided;
- imprisonment for up to 20 years;
- criminal fines of up to $5 million for individuals and $25 million for entities;
- civil fines of up to three times the profit gained, or loss avoided;
- a bar against serving as an officer or director of a public company; and
- an injunction against future violations.

Civil and criminal penalties also apply to tipping. The SEC has imposed large penalties in tipping cases even when the disclosing person did not trade or gain any benefit from another person's trading.

Controlling person liability. As of the effective date of this Policy, the penalty for 'controlling person' liability is a civil fine of up to the greater of $2.1 million or three times the profit gained or loss avoided as a result of the insider trading violations, as well as potential criminal fines and imprisonment.

Company disciplinary actions. If  the  Company has a reasonable basis to conclude that you have failed to comply with this Policy, you may be subject to disciplinary action by the Company, up to and including dismissal for cause, regardless of whether or not your failure to comply with this Policy results in a violation of law. It is not necessary for the Company to wait for the filing or conclusion of any civil or criminal action against an alleged violator before taking disciplinary action. In addition, the Company may give stop transfer and other instructions to the Company's transfer agent to enforce compliance with this Policy. The Company may also notify and cooperate with the SEC, any other regulators, and securities exchanges about such suspected violations.

## Compliance Officer

Please direct any questions, requests or reports as to any of the matters discussed in this Policy to the Chief Legal Officer of the Company (' Compliance Officer '). The Compliance Officer is generally responsible for the administration of this Policy. The Compliance Officer may select others to assist with the execution of his or her duties.

## Reporting violations

It  is  your responsibility to help enforce this Policy. You should be alert to possible violations and promptly report violations or suspected violations of this Policy to the Compliance Officer. If your situation requires that your identity be kept secret, your anonymity will be preserved to the greatest extent reasonably possible. If you wish to remain anonymous, you may use our web-reporting tool available at https://www.elastic.co/about/trust. If you make an anonymous report, please provide as much detail as possible, including any evidence that you believe may be relevant to the issue.

## Personal responsibility

The ultimate responsibility for complying with this Policy and applicable laws and regulations rests with you. You should use your best judgment at all times and consult with your personal legal and financial advisors, as needed. We advise you to seek assistance if you have any questions at all. The rules relating to insider trading can be complex, and a violation of insider trading laws can carry severe consequences.

## PERSONS AND TRANSACTIONS COVERED BY THIS POLICY

## Persons covered by this Policy

This Policy applies globally to all directors, officers, employees, consultants, contractors and other agents (such as consultants and independent contractors) of the Company. References in this Policy to 'you' (as well as general references to directors, officers, employees and agents of the Company) should also be understood to include members of your immediate family, persons with whom you share a household, persons that are your economic dependents and any other individuals  or  entities  whose  transactions  in  securities  you  influence,  direct  or  control  (including,  for  example,  a  venture  or  other  investment  fund,  if  you influence, direct or control transactions by the fund). You are responsible for making sure that these other individuals and entities comply with this Policy.

## Types of transactions covered by this Policy

Except  as  discussed  in  the  section  entitled  ' Limited  Exceptions ,'  this  Policy  applies  to all transactions  involving any securities  of  the  Company  or  the securities of other companies as to which you possess material nonpublic information obtained in the course of your service with the Company. This Policy therefore  applies  to  purchases,  sales,  bona  fide  gifts  and  other  transfers  of  ordinary  shares,  options,  warrants,  preferred  shares,  debt  securities  (such  as debentures, bonds and notes) and other securities. This Policy also applies to any arrangements that affect economic exposure to changes in the prices of these securities. These arrangements may include, among other things, transactions in derivative securities (such as exchange-traded put or call options), hedging transactions, short sales and certain decisions with respect to participation in benefit plans. This Policy also applies to any offers with respect to the transactions discussed above. You should note that there are no exceptions from insider trading laws or this Policy based on the size of the transaction.

## Responsibilities regarding the nonpublic information of other companies

This  Policy  prohibits  the  unauthorized  disclosure  or  other  misuse  of  any  nonpublic  information  of  other  companies,  such  as  the  Company's  distributors, vendors, customers, collaborators, suppliers and competitors. This Policy also prohibits insider trading and tipping based on the material nonpublic information of other companies.

## Applicability of this Policy after your departure

You  are  expected  to  comply  with  this  Policy  until  such  time  as  you  are  no  longer  affiliated  with  the  Company and you  no  longer  possess  any  material nonpublic information subject to this Policy. In addition, if you are subject to a trading blackout under this Policy at the time you cease to be affiliated with the Company, you are expected to abide by the applicable trading restrictions until at least the end of the relevant blackout period.

## No exceptions based on personal circumstances

There may be instances where you suffer financial harm or other hardship or are otherwise required to forgo a planned transaction because of the restrictions imposed by this Policy. Personal financial emergency or other personal circumstances are not mitigating factors under securities laws and will not excuse a failure to comply with this Policy.

## MATERIAL NONPUBLIC INFORMATION

## 'Material' information

Information should be regarded as material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider it important in deciding whether to buy, hold or sell securities or would view the information as significantly altering the total mix of information in the marketplace about the issuer of the security. In general,  any  information  that  could  reasonably  be  expected  to  affect  the  market  price  of  a  security  is  likely  to  be  material.  Either  positive  or  negative information may be material.

It is not possible to define all categories of 'material' information. However, some examples of information with respect to the Company or another issuer of securities that would often be regarded as material include information with respect to:

- Sales  performance  or  forecasts,  such  as  bookings  attainment,  bookings  results  or  forecasts,  renewals  performance,  or  professional  services performance;
- Financial results, financial condition, earnings pre-announcements, guidance, projections or forecasts, particularly if inconsistent with the expectations of the investment community;
- Restatements of financial results, or material impairments, write-offs or restructurings;
- Changes in independent auditors, or notification that the Company or other issuer may no longer rely on an audit report;
- Business plans or budgets;
- Creation of significant financial obligations, or any significant default under or acceleration of any financial obligation;
- Impending bankruptcy or financial liquidity problems;
- Significant developments involving business relationships, including execution, modification or termination of significant agreements or orders with customers, suppliers, distributors, manufacturers or other business partners;
- Significant  product  introductions,  modifications,  defects  or  recalls  or  significant  pricing  changes  or  other  product  announcements  of  a  significant nature;
- Significant developments in research and development or relating to intellectual property;
- Significant legal or regulatory developments, whether actual or threatened;
- Major  events  involving  the  securities  of  the  Company  or  other  issuer,  including  calls  of  securities  for  redemption,  adoption  of  share  repurchase programs, option repricings, share splits, changes in dividend policies, public or private securities offerings, modification to the rights of security holders or notice of delisting;
- Significant  corporate  events,  such  as  a  pending  or  proposed  merger  or  acquisition,  joint  venture  or  tender  offer,  a  significant  investment,  the acquisition or disposition of a significant business or asset or a change in control of the Company or other issuer;
- Major personnel changes, such as changes in senior management or lay-offs;
- Data breaches or other cybersecurity events;
- Updates regarding any prior material disclosure that has materially changed; and
- The existence of a special blackout period.

If  you  have  any  questions  as  to  whether  information  should  be  considered  'material,'  you  should  consult  with  the  Compliance  Officer.  In  general,  it  is advisable to resolve any close questions as to the materiality of any information by assuming that the information is material.

## 'Nonpublic' information

Information is considered nonpublic if the information has not been broadly disseminated to the public for a sufficient period to be reflected in the price of the security. As  a  general  rule,  information  should  be  considered  nonpublic  until  at  least two  full  trading  days have  elapsed  after  the  information  is  broadly distributed to the public in a press release, a public filing with the SEC, a pre-announced public webcast or another broad, non-exclusionary form of public communication. However, depending upon the form of the announcement and the nature of the information, it is possible that information may not be fully absorbed by the marketplace until a later time. Even if information is widely known throughout the Company, it may still be nonpublic. Any questions as to whether information is nonpublic should be directed to the Compliance Officer.

The term ' trading day ' means a day on which national stock exchanges and the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Automated Quotation System are open for trading. A ' full ' trading day has elapsed when, after the public disclosure, trading in the relevant security has opened and then closed.

## POLICIES REGARDING MATERIAL NONPUBLIC INFORMATION

## Confidentiality of nonpublic information

The unauthorized use or disclosure of nonpublic information relating to the Company or other companies is prohibited. All nonpublic information you acquire in the course of your service with the Company may only be used for legitimate Company business purposes. In addition, nonpublic information of others should be handled in accordance with the terms of any relevant nondisclosure agreements, and the use of any such nonpublic information should be limited to the purpose for which it was disclosed.

You must use all reasonable efforts to safeguard nonpublic information in the Company's possession. You may not disclose nonpublic information about the Company or any other company, unless required by law, or unless (i) disclosure is required for legitimate Company business purposes, (ii) you are authorized to disclose the information and (iii) appropriate steps have been taken to prevent misuse of that information (including entering an appropriate nondisclosure agreement that restricts the disclosure and use of the information, if applicable). This restriction also applies to internal communications within the Company and to communications with agents of the Company. In cases where disclosing nonpublic information to third parties is required, you should coordinate with the Legal Department.

All  directors,  officers,  employees  and  agents  of  the  Company  are  required  to  sign  and  comply  with  an  At  Will  Employment,  Confidential  Information, Invention Assignment, and Arbitration Agreement.

## No trading on material nonpublic information

Except as discussed in the section entitled ' Limited Exceptions ,' you may not, directly or indirectly through others, engage in any transaction involving the Company's securities while aware of material nonpublic information relating to the Company. It is not an excuse that you did not 'use' the information in your transaction.

Similarly, you may not engage in transactions involving the securities of any other company if you are aware of material nonpublic information about that company (except to the extent the transactions are analogous to those presented in the section entitled ' Limited Exceptions ').  For  example,  you  may  be involved in a proposed transaction involving a prospective business relationship or transaction with another company. If information about that transaction constitutes material nonpublic information for that other company, you would be prohibited from engaging in transactions involving the securities of that other company (as well as transactions involving Company securities, if that information is material to the Company). It is important to note that 'materiality' is different for different companies. Information that is not material to the Company may be material to another company.

## No disclosing material nonpublic information for the benefit of others

You may not disclose material nonpublic information concerning the Company or any other company to friends, family members or any other person or entity not authorized to receive such information where such person or entity may benefit by trading on the basis of such information. In addition, you may not make recommendations or express opinions on the basis of material nonpublic information as to trading in the securities of companies to which such information relates. You are prohibited from engaging in these actions whether or not you derive any profit or personal benefit from doing so. The prohibition against disclosure of material nonpublic information includes disclosure (even anonymous disclosure) via the internet, blogs, investor forums or chat rooms where companies and their performance or prospects are discussed.

## Obligation to disclose material nonpublic information to the Company

You  may  not  enter  into  any  transaction,  including  those  discussed  in  the  section  entitled  ' Limited  Exceptions ,'  unless  you  have  disclosed  any  material nonpublic  information  that  you  become  aware  of  in  the  course  of  your  service  with  the  Company,  and  that  senior  management  is  not  aware  of,  to  the Compliance Officer. If you are a member of senior management, the information must be disclosed to the Chief Executive Officer, and if you are the Chief Executive  Officer  or  a  director,  you  must  disclose  the  information  to  the  Company's  board  of  directors  (' Board of Directors '),  before  any  transaction  is permissible.

## Responding to outside inquiries for information

In the event you receive an inquiry from someone outside of the Company, such as a stock analyst, for information, you should refer the inquiry to the Chief Legal Officer, the Chief Financial Officer or the head of Investor Relations. The Company is required under Regulation FD (Fair Disclosure) of the U.S. federal securities laws to avoid the selective disclosure of material nonpublic information. In general, the regulation provides that when a public company discloses  material  nonpublic  information,  it  must  provide  broad,  non-exclusionary  access  to  the  information.  Violations  of  this  regulation  can  subject  the Company to SEC enforcement actions, which may result in injunctions and severe monetary penalties. The Company has established procedures for releasing material information in a manner that is designed to achieve broad public dissemination of the information immediately upon its release in compliance with applicable law. Please consult the Company's External Communications Policy for more details.

## TRADING BLACKOUT PERIODS

To limit the likelihood of trading at times when there is a significant risk of insider trading exposure, the Company has instituted quarterly trading blackout periods and may institute special trading blackout periods from time to time. In addition, to comply with applicable legal requirements, the Company may also institute  blackout  periods  that  prevent  directors  and  officers  from  trading  in  Company  securities  at  a  time  when  employees  are  prevented  from  trading Company securities in the Company's 401(k) plan.

It  is  important  to  note  that  whether  or  not  you  are  subject  to  blackout  periods,  you  remain  subject  to  the  prohibitions  on  trading  on  the  basis  of  material nonpublic information and any other applicable restrictions in this Policy.

## Quarterly blackout periods

Except as discussed in the section entitled ' Limited Exceptions ,' directors, executive officers and other employees and agents of the Company must refrain from conducting transactions involving the Company's securities during quarterly blackout periods.

Quarterly blackout periods begin at the beginning of the first day of the third month of each fiscal quarter and end at the start of the second full trading day following the date of public disclosure of the financial results for that fiscal quarter. This period is a particularly sensitive time for transactions involving the Company's securities from the perspective of compliance with applicable securities laws due to the fact that, during this period, individuals could possess or have access to material nonpublic information relevant to the expected financial results for the quarter. For instance, if the Company were to disclose results for the third fiscal quarter (ending on January 31) before the start of trading on Friday, March 1, the quarterly blackout period would run from January 1 to the start of trading on Tuesday, March 5. If the Company were to disclose results after the start of trading on Friday, March 1, the quarterly blackout period would end at the start of trading on Wednesday, March 6. The next quarterly blackout period would commence on April 1.

## Special blackout periods

From time to time, the Company may also prohibit directors, officers, employees and agents from engaging in transactions involving the Company's securities when, in the judgment of the Compliance Officer, a trading blackout is warranted. The Company will generally impose special blackout periods when there are material developments known to the Company that have not yet been disclosed to the public. For example, the Company may impose a special blackout period in  anticipation  of  announcing  interim  earnings  guidance  or  a  significant  transaction  or  business  development.  However,  special  blackout  periods  may  be declared for any reason.

The Company will notify those persons subject to a special blackout period. Each person who has been so identified and notified by the Company may not engage in any transaction involving the Company's securities until instructed otherwise by the Compliance Officer, and should not disclose to others the fact of such suspension of trading. Even if you have not been notified of a special blackout period, but are aware of material nonpublic information, the restrictions under this Policy still apply to you.

## Regulation BTR blackouts

Directors and executive officers may also be subject to trading blackouts pursuant to Regulation Blackout Trading Restriction (' Regulation BTR ') under U.S. federal  securities  laws.  In  general,  Regulation  BTR  prohibits  any  director  or  executive  officer  from  engaging  in  certain  transactions  involving  Company securities  during  periods  when  401(k)  plan  participants  are  prevented  from  purchasing,  selling  or  otherwise  acquiring  or  transferring  an  interest  in  certain securities held in individual account plans. Any profits realized from a transaction that violates Regulation BTR are recoverable by the Company, regardless of the intentions of the director or officer effecting the transaction. In addition, individuals who engage in such transactions are subject to sanctions by the SEC, as well as

potential criminal liability. The Company has provided, or will provide, separate memoranda and other appropriate materials to its directors and executive officers regarding compliance with Regulation BTR.

The Company will notify directors and officers if they are subject to a blackout trading restriction under Regulation BTR. Failure to comply with an applicable trading blackout in accordance with Regulation BTR is a violation of law and this Policy.

## No 'safe harbors'

There are no unconditional 'safe harbors' for trades made at particular times, and all persons subject to this Policy should exercise good judgment at all times. Even when a quarterly blackout period is not in effect, you may be prohibited from engaging in transactions involving the Company's securities because you possess material nonpublic information, are subject to a special blackout period or are otherwise restricted under this Policy.

## PRE-CLEARANCE OF TRADES

Except as discussed in the section entitled ' Limited Exceptions ,' directors and executive officers should refrain from engaging in any transaction involving the  Company's  securities  without  first  obtaining  pre -clearance  of  the  transaction  from  the  Compliance  Officer,  who  will  seek  further  pre-clearance  of  the transaction from the Company's Chief Financial Officer or Corporate Controller. In addition, the Company has determined that certain other employees and agents of the Company that may have regular or special access to material nonpublic information should refrain from engaging in any transaction involving the Company's securities without first obtaining pre -clearance of the transaction from the Compliance Officer. The Compliance Officer will provide notice from time to time to the other employees and agents whom the Company has determined should be subject to the pre-clearance requirements. The Compliance Officer  may  not  engage  in  a  transaction  involving  the  Company's  securities  unless  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  Chief  Financial  Officer  or  Corporate Controller have pre-cleared the transaction.

These pre-clearance  procedures  are  intended  to  decrease  insider  trading  risks  associated  with  transactions  by  individuals  with  regular  or  special  access  to material  nonpublic  information.  In  addition,  requiring  pre -clearance  of  transactions  by  directors  and  officers  facilitates  compliance  with  Rule  144  resale restrictions under the Securities Act, the liability and reporting provisions of Section 16 (' Section 16 ') of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ' Exchange Act '),  and  Regulation  BTR.  Pre-clearance  of  a  trade,  however,  is  not  a  defense  to  a  claim  of  insider  trading  and  does  not  excuse  you  from otherwise complying with insider trading laws or this Policy. Further, pre-clearance of a transaction does not constitute an affirmation by the Company or the Compliance Officer that you are not in possession of material nonpublic information.

The Compliance Officer is under no obligation to approve a transaction submitted for pre-clearance, and may determine not to permit the transaction. Further, pre-clearance of a transaction may take some time, so individuals subject to pre-clearance requirements are encouraged to allow sufficient time to obtain preclearance.

## ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS AND GUIDANCE

This section addresses certain types of transactions that may expose you and the Company to significant risks. You should understand that, even though a transaction may not be expressly prohibited by this section, you are responsible for ensuring that the transaction otherwise complies with other provisions in this Policy that may apply to the transaction, such as the general prohibition against insider trading as well as pre-clearance procedures and blackout periods, to the extent applicable.

## Short sales

Short sales ( i.e., the sale of a security that must be borrowed to make delivery) and 'selling short against the box' ( i.e., a sale with a delayed delivery) with respect to Company securities are prohibited under this Policy. Short sales may signal to the market possible bad news about the Company or a general lack of confidence in the Company's prospects, and an expectation that the value of the Company's securities will decline. In addition, short sales are effectively a bet against the Company's success and may reduce the seller's incentive to improve the Company's performance. Short sales may also create a suspicion that the seller is engaged in insider trading.

## Derivative securities and hedging transactions

You  are  prohibited  from  engaging  in  transactions  in  publicly-traded  options,  such  as  puts  and  calls,  and  other  derivative  securities  with  respect  to  the Company's  securities.  This  prohibition  extends  to  any  hedging  or  similar  transaction  designed  to  decrease  the  risks  associated  with  holding  Company securities. Share options, share appreciation rights and other securities issued pursuant to Company benefit plans or other compensatory arrangements with the Company are not subject to the prohibition described in this paragraph.

Transactions in derivative securities may reflect a short -term and speculative interest in the Company's securities and may create the appearance of impropriety, even where a transaction does not involve trading on inside information. Trading in derivatives may also focus attention on short-term performance at the expense of the Company's long-term objectives. In addition, the application of securities laws to derivatives transactions can be complex, and persons engaging in derivatives transactions may subject themselves to an increased risk of violating securities laws.

## Using Company securities as collateral for loans

You  may  not  pledge  Company  securities  as  collateral  for  loans.  If  you  default  on  the  loan,  the  lender  may  sell  the  pledged  securities  as  collateral  in  a foreclosure sale. The sale, even though not initiated at your request, is still considered a sale for your benefit and, if made at a time when you are aware of material nonpublic information or otherwise are not permitted to trade in Company securities, may result in inadvertent insider trading violations, Section 16 and Regulation BTR violations (for officers and directors), violations of this Policy and unfavorable publicity for you and the Company.

## Holding Company securities in margin accounts

You may not hold Company securities in margin accounts. Under typical margin arrangements, if you fail to meet a margin call, the broker may be entitled to sell securities held in the margin account without your consent. The sale, even though not initiated at your request, is still considered a sale for your benefit and, if  made at a time when you are aware of material nonpublic information or are otherwise not permitted to trade, may result in inadvertent insider trading violations, Section 16 and Regulation BTR violations (for officers and directors), violations of this Policy and unfavorable publicity for you and the Company.

## Placing open orders with brokers

Except in accordance with an approved trading plan (as discussed below), you should exercise caution when placing open orders, such as limit orders or stop orders, with brokers, particularly where the order is likely to remain outstanding for an extended period of time. Open orders may result in the execution of a trade at a time when you are aware of material nonpublic information or otherwise are not permitted to trade in Company securities, which may result in inadvertent insider trading violations, Section 16 and Regulation BTR violations (for officers and directors), violations of this Policy and unfavorable publicity for you and the Company. If you are subject to blackout periods or pre-clearance requirements, you should so inform any broker with whom you place any open order at the time it is placed.

## LIMITED EXCEPTIONS

The following are certain limited exceptions to the restrictions imposed by the Company under this Policy. Please be aware that even if a transaction is subject to an exception to this Policy, you will need to separately assess whether the transaction complies with applicable law. For example, even if a transaction is indicated as exempt from this Policy, you may need to comply with the 'short-swing' trading restrictions under Section 16 of the Exchange Act, to the extent applicable. You are responsible for complying with applicable law at all times.

## Transactions pursuant to a trading plan that complies with SEC rules

The SEC has enacted rules that provide an affirmative defense against alleged violations of U.S. federal insider trading laws for transactions pursuant to trading plans that meet certain requirements. In general, these rules, as set forth in Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act (' Rule 10b5-1 '), provide for an affirmative defense  if  you  enter  into  a  contract,  provide  instructions  or  adopt  a  written  plan  for  trading  securities  when  you  are  not  aware  of  material  nonpublic information. The contract, instructions or plan must (i) specify the amount, price and date of the transaction, (ii) specify an objective method for determining the  amount,  price  and  date  of  the  transaction  and/or  (iii)  place  any  subsequent  discretion  for  determining  the  amount,  price  and  date  of  the  transaction  in another person who is not, at the time of the transaction, aware of material nonpublic information.

Transactions  made  pursuant  to  a  written  trading  plan  that  (i)  complies  with  the  affirmative  defense  set  forth  in  Rule  10b5-1  and  (ii)  is  approved  by  the Compliance Officer, are not subject to the restrictions in this Policy against trades made while aware of material nonpublic information or to the pre-clearance procedures  or  blackout  periods  established  under  this  Policy.  In  approving  a  trading  plan,  the  Compliance  Officer  may,  in  furtherance  of  the  objectives expressed in this Policy, impose criteria in addition to those set forth in Rule 10b5-1. You should therefore confer with the Compliance Officer prior to entering into any trading plan.

The SEC rules regarding trading plans are complex and must be complied with completely to be effective. The description provided above is only a summary, and the Company strongly advises that you consult with your legal advisor if you intend to adopt a trading plan. While trading plans are subject to review and approval by the Company, the individual adopting the trading plan is ultimately responsible for compliance with Rule 10b5-1 and ensuring that the trading plan complies with this Policy, including the Requirements for Trading Plans and the Guidelines for Trading Plans attached as Schedule II to this Policy as well as any other guidelines for Trading Plans established by the Company.

Trading plans must be filed with the Compliance Officer and must be accompanied with an executed certificate stating that the trading plan complies with Rule 10b5-1 and any other criteria established by the Company.

SEC rules require the Company to disclose in its periodic SEC reports whether the Company's directors and executive officers have adopted or terminated Rule 10b5-1 trading plans during the Company's last fiscal quarter, as well the material terms of any such trading plan (other than the prices at which trades are authorized), such as the name of the director or executive officer, the date of adoption or termination of the plan, the duration of the plan, and the total number of securities to be purchased or sold under the plan. For purposes of this reporting requirement, any modification or change to the amount, price or timing of the purchase or sale of securities underlying an existing plan would constitute the termination of that plan and the adoption of a new plan.

The Company also is required under SEC rules to report comparable information about the adoption or termination by any director or executive officer of any other written pre-planned trading arrangement that meets specified criteria but does not qualify for the affirmative defense to Rule 10b5 liability under Rule 10b5-1.

## Participation in Elastic N.V. 2022 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ('ESPP')

The trading restrictions under this Policy apply to any sales or other transfers of shares purchased through the ESPP. Except as otherwise determined by the Compliance Officer, the trading restrictions under this Policy do not apply to (i) purchases of Company shares under the ESPP resulting from your periodic contributions of money to the ESPP pursuant to your payroll deduction election, or (ii) the elections you may make under the ESPP to (a) enroll or re-enroll in the  ESPP,  (b)  increase  or  decrease  the  amount  of  your  periodic  payroll  deductions  that  will  be  used  to  purchase  Company  shares,  (c)  suspend  payroll deductions, or (d) withdraw from the ESPP.

## Receipt and vesting of share options, restricted shares and share appreciation rights

The trading restrictions under this Policy do not apply to the acceptance of share options, restricted shares or share appreciation rights issued or offered by the Company, or the purchase of restricted shares. The trading restrictions under this Policy also do not apply to the vesting, cancellation or forfeiture of share options, restricted shares or share appreciation rights in accordance with applicable plans and agreements. However, the sale of securities described in this paragraph remains subject to the Policy.

The trading restrictions under this Policy do not apply to the net share withholding of equity awards where shares are withheld by the Company in order to satisfy  tax  withholding  requirements,  so  long  as  the  election  is  irrevocable  and  made  in  writing  at  a  time  when  a  trading  blackout  is  not  in  place  and  the individual is not in possession of material nonpublic information. In addition, the trading restrictions under this Policy do not apply to sell to cover transactions, to the extent approved and implemented by the Company, where shares are sold by the individual in order to satisfy tax withholding requirements.

## Exercise of share options for cash

The trading restrictions under this Policy do not apply to the exercise of share options for cash under the Company's share option plans. Likewise, the trading restrictions under this Policy do not apply to the exercise of share options in a share-for-share exercise with the Company or an election to have the Company withhold securities to cover tax obligations in connection with an option exercise, so long as that election is irrevocable and made in writing at a time when a trading blackout is not in place and the individual is not in possession of material nonpublic information. However, the trading restrictions under this Policy do apply to (i) the sale of any securities issued upon the exercise of a share option, (ii) a cashless exercise of a share option through a broker, since this involves selling a portion of the underlying shares to cover the costs of exercise, and (iii) any other market sale for the purpose of generating the cash needed to pay the exercise price of an option.

## Share splits, share dividends and similar transactions

The trading restrictions under this Policy do not apply to a change in the number of securities held as a result of a share split or share dividend applying equally to all securities of a class, or similar transactions.

## Change in form of ownership

Certain transactions that involve merely a change in the form in which you own securities may be permissible. For example, you may transfer shares to an inter vivos trust of which you are the sole beneficiary during your lifetime. Contact the Compliance Officer if you are considering such a transaction.

## Bona fide gifts, charitable contributions and inheritance

Dispositions of Company securities by bona fide gifts (including charitable contributions) are not transactions restricted by this Policy unless the donor making the gift has reason to believe that the recipient intends to sell the securities while the donor is aware of material nonpublic information or is subject to a trading blackout period.  Any such transactions, as well as any transaction involving a transfer of Company securities by will or the laws of

descent or distribution (to which the trading restrictions of this Policy do not apply), shall be subject to pre-clearance by the Compliance Officer or, in the absence of the Compliance Officer, the Chief Financial Officer.

## Other exceptions

Any other exception from this Policy must be approved by the Compliance Officer, in consultation with the Board of Directors or an independent committee of the Board of Directors (or chair of such a committee).

18

## COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 16 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT

## Obligations under Section 16

Section 16 of the Exchange Act, and the related rules and regulations, set forth (i) reporting obligations, (ii) limitations on 'short-swing' transactions and (iii) limitations on short sales and other transactions applicable to directors, officers, large shareholders and certain other persons. The Company has provided, or will provide, memoranda and other materials addressing these matters.

The Company will notify those persons required to comply with Section 16 of the Exchange Act , and the related rules and regulations, because of their positions with the Company. The Compliance Officer may amend the list of persons receiving this notice from time to time to reflect the election of new officers or directors, any change in the responsibilities of officers or other employees and any promotions, demotions, resignations or departures.

## Notification requirements to facilitate Section 16 reporting

To facilitate timely reporting of transactions pursuant to Section 16 requirements, each person subject to Section 16 reporting requirements must provide, or must ensure that his or her broker provides, the Company with detailed information (trade date, number of shares, exact price, use of a trading plan and other required information) regarding his or her transactions involving the Company's securities, including gifts, transfers, pledges and transactions pursuant to a trading plan, both prior to (to confirm compliance with pre-clearance procedures, if applicable) and promptly following execution.

## Personal responsibility

The obligation to file Section 16 reports, and to otherwise comply with Section 16, is personal. The Company is not responsible for the failure to comply with Section 16 requirements.

## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

## Delivery of Policy

This Policy will be delivered to all directors, officers, employees and agents of the Company when they commence service with the Company. In addition, this Policy (or a summary of this Policy) will be circulated periodically. Each director, officer, employee and agent of the Company is required to acknowledge that he or she understands, and agrees to comply with, this Policy.

We are committed to continuously reviewing and updating our policies and procedures. The Company therefore reserves the right to amend, alter or terminate this Policy at any time and for any reason, subject to applicable law. A current copy of the Company's policies regarding insider trading may be obtained by contacting the Compliance Officer or, following the filing of this Policy with the SEC as an exhibit to the Company's annual report on Form 10-K, may be viewed on the SEC's website.

Nothing in this Insider Trading  Policy  shall  limit  the  right  to  terminate  employment  at-will.  No  employee  of  the  Company  has  any  authority  to  enter  into  any  agreement  for employment for a specified period of time or to make any agreement or representation contrary to the Company's policy of employment at-will. Only the Chief Executive Officer of the Company has the authority to make any such agreement, which must be in writing.

## SCHEDULE II

## ELASTIC N.V. REQUIREMENTS FOR TRADING PLANS

(Amended and Restated: April 19, 2023)

For  transactions  under  a  trading  plan  to  be  exempt  from  (i)  the  prohibitions  in  the  Company's  insider  trading  policy  (the  ' Insider  Trading Policy ')  with respect to transactions made while aware of material nonpublic information and (ii) the pre-clearance procedures and blackout periods established under the Insider Trading Policy, the trading plan and the person adopting the trading plan must comply with the conditions to the availability of the affirmative defense set forth in Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) under the Exchange Act, as amended (the ' Exchange Act '), and meet other requirements as set forth below. Each reference in this Schedule II to a ' trading plan ' refers to a trading plan that meets the conditions to the availability of the affirmative defense set forth in Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) under the Exchange Act:

## ELASTIC N.V.

## INCENTIVE-BASED COMPENSATION RECOVERY POLICY

(ADOPTED ON NOVEMBER 28, 2023)

1. Policy Purpose . The purpose of this Elastic N.V. Incentive-Based Compensation Recovery Policy (this ' Policy ') is to enable Elastic N.V . (the ' Company ') and its affiliates to recover Erroneously Awarded Compensation in the event of an Accounting Restatement. This Policy is intended to comply with the requirements set forth in Section 303A.14 of the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual (the ' Listing Rule ') and shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with such intent. Unless otherwise defined in this Policy, capitalized terms shall have the meaning ascribed to such terms in paragraph 7.
2. Policy Administration . This Policy shall be administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board (the ' Committee ') unless the Board determines to administer this Policy itself. The Committee has full and final authority to make all determinations under this Policy, in each case to the extent permitted under the Listing Rule and in compliance with (or pursuant to an exemption from the application of) Section 409A of the Code. All determinations and decisions made by the Committee pursuant to the provisions of this Policy shall be final, conclusive and binding on all persons, including the Company, its affiliates, its shareholders , and Executive Officers. Any action or inaction by the Committee with respect to an Executive Officer under this Policy in no way shall limit the Committee's actions or decisions not to act with respect to any other Executive Officer under this Policy or under any similar policy, agreement or arrangement, nor shall any such action or inaction serve as a waiver of any rights the Company may have against any Executive Officer other than as set forth in this Policy.
3. Policy Application . This Policy applies to all Incentive-Based Compensation received by a person: (a) after beginning service as an Executive Officer; (b) who served as an Executive Officer at any time during the performance period for such Incentive-Based Compensation; (c) while the Company had a class of securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange (' NYSE ') or another national securities exchange or a national securities association; and (d) during the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the Accounting Restatement Date. In addition to such last three completed fiscal years, the immediately preceding clause (d) includes any transition period that results from a change in the Company's fiscal year within or immediately following such three completed fiscal years; provided that, a transition period between the last day of the Company's previous fiscal year end and the first day of its new fiscal year that constitutes a period of nine to twelve months shall be deemed a completed fiscal year. For purposes of this paragraph 3, Incentive-Based Compensation shall be deemed received in the Company's fiscal period during which the Financial Reporting Measure specified in the Incentive-Based Compensation award is attained, even if the payment or grant of the Incentive-Based Compensation occurs after the end of such fiscal period. Incentive-Based Compensation that is subject to both a Financial Reporting Measure vesting condition and a service-based vesting condition shall be considered received when the relevant Financial Reporting Measure is achieved, even if the Incentive-Based Compensation continues to be subject to the service-based vesting condition.
4. Policy Recovery Requirement . In the case of an Accounting Restatement, the Company must recover, reasonably promptly, Erroneously Awarded Compensation in amounts determined pursuant to this Policy. The Company's obligation to recover Erroneously Awarded Compensation is not dependent on whether or when the Company files restated financial statements. Recovery under this Policy with respect to an Executive Officer shall not require a finding of any misconduct by such Executive Officer or a finding that such Executive Officer was responsible for the accounting error leading to an Accounting Restatement. In the event of an Accounting Restatement, the Company shall satisfy the Company's obligations under this Policy to recover any amount owed from any applicable Executive Officer by exercising its sole and absolute discretion in how to accomplish such a recovery, to the extent permitted under the Listing Rule and in compliance with (or pursuant to an exemption from the application of) Section 409A of the Code.

The Company's recovery obligation pursuant to this paragraph 4 shall not apply to the extent that the Committee or, in the absence of the Committee, a majority of the independent directors serving on the Board determines that such recovery would be impracticable and:

- (a) the direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered; provided that, before concluding that it would be impracticable to recover any amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation based on the expense of enforcement, the Company shall make a reasonable attempt to recover such Erroneously Awarded Compensation, document such reasonable attempt to recover, and provide such documentation to the NYSE; or
- (b) recovery would violate home country law where that law was adopted prior to November 28, 2022; provided that, before concluding that it would be impracticable to recover any amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation based on a violation of home country law, the Company shall obtain an opinion of home country counsel, acceptable to the NYSE, that recovery would result in such a violation, and must provide such opinion to the NYSE; or
- (c) recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the Company, to fail to meet the requirements of Section 401(a)(13) of the Code or Section 411(a) of the Code.
5. Policy Prohibition on Indemnification and Insurance Reimbursement . The Company is prohibited from indemnifying any Executive Officer against the loss of Erroneously Awarded Compensation. Further, the Company is prohibited from paying or reimbursing an Executive Officer for purchasing insurance to cover any such loss.
6. Required Policy-Related Filings . The Company shall file all disclosures with respect to this Policy in accordance with the requirements of the federal securities laws, including disclosures required by rules or regulations promulgated by the SEC.

## 7. Definitions.

- (b) ' Accounting Restatement Date ' means the earlier to occur of: (i) the date on which the Board, a committee of the Board, or the officer or officers of the Company authorized to take such action (if Board action is not required) concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement; and (ii) the date on which a court, regulator or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare an Accounting Restatement.
