## COMPANY AND BUSINESS OVERVIEW

Elastic, the Search AI Company, enables our customers to find the answers they need in real time, using all of their data, at scale. The Elastic Search AI Platform ('our platform'), combines the power of search with AI to help companies solve real-time business problems, unlock potential value, and achieve better outcomes. Our platform, available as both a hosted, managed service across public clouds as well as self-managed software, allows our customers to find insights and drive AI and machine learning use cases from large amounts of data.

We offer three search-powered solutions - Search, Observability, and Security - that are built on the platform. We help organizations, their employees, and their customers find what they need faster, while keeping mission-critical applications running smoothly, and protecting against cyber threats.

As digital transformation drives mission-critical business functions to the cloud, we believe that every company must incorporate search AI capabilities across information technology ("IT") and line-of-business organizations to find the answers that matter from all of its data in real-time and at scale.

Our platform is built on the Elastic Stack, a powerful set of software products that ingest data from any source, in any format, and perform search, analysis, and visualization of that data. At the core of the Elastic Stack is Elasticsearch - a highly scalable document store and search engine, and the unified data store for all of our solutions and use cases. Another component of the Elastic Stack is Kibana, which delivers a common user interface across all of our solutions, with powerful drag-and-drop visual analytics, and centralized management of the platform. Our platform also includes the Elasticsearch Relevance Engine™ ('ESRE'), which combines advanced AI with Elastic's text search to give developers a full suite of sophisticated retrieval algorithms and the ability to integrate with large language models. Our out-of-the-box solutions deliver fast time to value for common use cases and, paired with our developer-centric platform which is extensible and customizable, allow us to innovate fast and differentiate our offerings at every level.

We make our platform available as a hosted, managed service across major cloud providers (Amazon Web Services ('AWS'), Google Cloud Platform ('GCP'), and Microsoft Azure) in more than 55 public cloud regions globally. Customers can also deploy our platform across hybrid clouds, public or private clouds, and multicloud environments.

Our business model is based primarily on a combination of a paid Elastic-managed hosted service offering and paid and free proprietary self-managed software. Our paid offerings for our platform are sold via subscription through resource-based pricing, and all customers and users have access to varying levels of features across all solutions. In Elastic Cloud, our family of cloud-based offerings, we offer various subscription tiers tied to different features. For users who download our software, we make some of the features of our software available free of charge, allowing us to engage with a broad community of developers and practitioners and introduce them to the value of the Elastic Stack. We believe in the importance of an open software development model, and we develop the majority of our software in public repositories as open code under a proprietary license. Unlike some companies, we do not build an enterprise version that is separate from our free distribution. We maintain a single code base across both our selfmanaged software and Elastic-hosted services. All of these actions help us build a powerful commercial business model that we believe is optimized for product-driven growth.

Our customers often significantly expand their usage of our products and services over time. Expansion includes increasing the number of developers and practitioners using our products, increasing the utilization of our products for a particular use case, and utilizing our products to address new use cases. We focus some of our direct sales efforts on encouraging this type of expansion within our customer base, both within as well as across solutions. Because our business model provides access to all solutions with resourcebased pricing, we make it easy for customers to expand across use cases.

Our business has experienced rapid growth around the world. As of April 30, 2024, we had approximately 21,000 customers compared to approximately 20,200 customers as of April 30, 2023. Our total revenue was $1.267 billion and $1.069 billion for the years ended April 30, 2024 ("fiscal 2024") and 2023 ("fiscal 2023"), respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 19% for the year ended April 30, 2024. Subscriptions accounted for 93% and 92% of our total revenue for the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Revenue from outside the Netherlands accounted for 97% of our total revenue for the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023.

While we recorded a net income of $59.2 million for the year ended April 30, 2024, we incurred a net loss of $276.1 million for the year ended April 30, 2023. Although we recorded net income for the year ended April 30, 2024, we expect to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. Our net cash provided by operating activities was $134.7 million and $30.9 million for the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

## Our Products

Our products enable our customers and users to find relevant information and insights nearly instantly in large amounts of data across a broad range of business and consumer use cases.

We offer the Elastic Stack, a powerful set of software products that ingest and store data from any source, in any format, and perform search, analysis, and visualization, usually in milliseconds. The Elastic Stack can be used by developers and IT decision makers to power a variety of use cases. We also offer software solutions built in the Elastic Stack that address a wide variety of use cases. The Elastic Stack and our solutions are designed to run in public or private clouds, in hybrid environments, or in multi-cloud environments.

## The Elastic Stack

The Elastic Stack is primarily composed of the following products:

- Elasticsearch. Elasticsearch is the heart of the Elastic Stack. It is a distributed, real-time vector search and analytics engine and data store for all types of data, including textual, numerical, geospatial, structured, and unstructured.
- Kibana. Kibana is the user interface for the Elastic Stack. It is the visualization layer for data stored in Elasticsearch. It is also the management and configuration interface for all parts of the Elastic Stack

Elastic has spent years infusing both Elasticsearch and Kibana with a foundation of AI and machine learning built on ESRE, from support for external machine learning models to native vector search capabilities, supervised and unsupervised machine learning, and solution capabilities that improve search relevance and identify anomalies. Elastic enables organizations to integrate generative AI and large language models by building key capabilities into its products.

The Elastic Stack also supports data ingest with a number of products:

- Elastic Agent. Elastic Agent is a single, unified way to add monitoring for logs, metrics, and other types of data to each host. Elastic Agent includes integrated host protection and central management.
- Beats. Beats is the family of lightweight, single-purpose data shippers for sending data from edge machines to Elasticsearch or Logstash.
- Logstash. Logstash is the dynamic data processing pipeline for ingesting data into Elasticsearch or other storage systems from a multitude of sources simultaneously.

Paid proprietary features in the Elastic Stack enable capabilities such as automating anomaly detection on time series data at scale through machine learning, facilitating compliance with data security and privacy regulations, supporting search across low cost cold and frozen data tiers, and allowing real-time notifications and alerts. The source code of features in the Elastic Stack is generally visible to the public in the form of 'open code.'

## Our Solutions

We have built a number of solutions into the Elastic Stack to make it easier for organizations to use our software for common use cases. Our solutions include the following:

- Search. Our Search solution provides a powerful search platform for building search AI applications. Key use cases for Search include: generative AI and retrieval-augmented generation, search applications, and foundational capabilities for building search experiences to support websites and portals, e-commerce, mobile app search, customer support, and workplace search.
- Observability. Our Observability solution enables unified analysis across the IT ecosystem of applications, networks, and infrastructure. Observability includes: Logs, to search and analyze petabytes of structured and unstructured logs; Metrics, to search and analyze numeric and time series data; Application Performance Monitoring ('APM'), to deliver insight into application performance and health metrics and provide developers with confidence in their code; and Synthetic Monitoring, to proactively monitor the availability and functionality of user journeys.
- Security. Our Security solution provides unified protection to prevent, detect, and respond to threats. Our AI-driven security analytics solution includes: Security Information and Event Management ('SIEM'), with integrations to network, host, user, and cloud data sources, as well as workflow and operations, shareable analytics, incident management, and investigations; extended protection with both third party integrations as well as first party protections for both Endpoint Security (prevention, detection, and response) and Cloud Security (cloud posture assessment, vulnerability management, and cloud workload protection).

## Our Deployment Options

The Elastic Stack and our solutions can be deployed in public or private clouds, in hybrid environments, or in multi-cloud environments, to satisfy various user and customer needs. Elastic Cloud, our family of cloudbased offerings, is hosted on major public cloud providers. We also partner with other cloud providers who offer our software to users on their cloud platform as a hosted offering.

Users can also download and manage their own deployments of the Elastic Stack and our solutions. To help with more complex deployment scenarios, we offer paid proprietary products to deliver centralized provisioning, management, and monitoring across multiple deployments.

Technology Features of the Elastic Stack

Elasticsearch is the heart of the Elastic Stack, where users store, search, and analyze data. Key features of Elasticsearch include the following:

- Storage of any type of data. Elasticsearch combines powerful parts of traditional search engines, such as an inverted index to power fast full-text search and a column store for analytics, with native support for a wide range of data types, including text, dates, numbers, geospatial data, date/numeric ranges, and IP addresses. With sensible defaults, and no upfront schema definition necessary, Elasticsearch makes it easy to start with simple storage solutions and finetune them as datasets grow.
- Vector search. Elastic natively supports vector search as part of ESRE, which enables a wide range of advanced search use cases that improve relevance, including sophisticated search ranking, image search, question answering, and more. Vector search relies on a next generation of machine learning models that can represent many types of content as vectors, including text, images, events, and more. ESRE also supports integration with large language models. As data volumes and formats proliferate, this sophisticated approach to search and relevance is becoming important for use cases where delivering maximum relevance is critical.
- Machine learning, AI, and alerting. Machine learning capabilities such as anomaly detection, forecasting, and categorization are tightly integrated with the Elastic Stack to automatically model the behavior of data, such as trends and periodicity, in real time to identify issues faster, streamline root cause analysis, and reduce false positives. Without these capabilities, it can be very difficult to identify issues such as infrastructure problems or intruders in real time across complex, high-volume, fast-moving datasets. In the last few years, we have also added native support for vector search and model management for advanced machine learning models.
- Powerful query languages. The Elasticsearch query domain specific language is a flexible, expressive search language that exposes a rich set of query capabilities across any kind of data. From simple Boolean operators to custom relevance functions, users can articulate exactly what they are looking for and bring their own definition of relevance. The query language also includes a composable aggregation framework that enables users to summarize, disaggregate, and analyze structured or semi-structured datasets across multiple dimensions. Examples of these capabilities, all with a single search, include tracking the top ten users by expenditure level, looking at data week over week, analyzing data across geographies, and drilling down into details with specific filters.
- Developer friendliness. Elasticsearch has consistent, well-documented application programming interfaces ('APIs') that work the same way on one node during initial development as on a hundred nodes in production. Elasticsearch also ships with a number of language clients that provide a natural way to integrate with a variety of popular programming frameworks, reducing the learning curve, and leading to a shorter time to realizing value.
- High speed. Everything stored in Elasticsearch is indexed by default, so users do not need to decide in advance what queries they will want to run. Our architecture optimizes throughput, time-to-data availability and query latency. Elasticsearch can index millions of events per second, and newly added data can be available for search nearly instantly.
- High scale and availability. Elasticsearch is designed to scale horizontally and be resilient to node or hardware failures. As nodes join a cluster, data is automatically re-balanced and queries and indexing are spread across the new nodes seamlessly. This makes it easy to add hardware to increase indexing throughput or improve query throughput. Elasticsearch also detects node failures and hardware or network issues and automatically protects user data by eliminating the failing or inaccessible nodes and creating new replicas of the data.
- Security. Security features give administrators the rights to grant specific levels of access to their various types of users, such as IT, operations, and application teams. Elasticsearch serves as the central authentication hub for the entire Elastic Stack. Security features include encrypted communications and encryption-at-rest; role-based access control; single sign-on and authentication; field-level, attribute-level, and document-level security; and audit logging.

Kibana is the user interface for the Elastic Stack. It allows users to manage the Elastic Stack and visualize data. Additionally, the interfaces for many of our solutions are built into Kibana. Key features of Kibana include the following:

- Exploration and visualization of data stored in Elasticsearch. Kibana provides interactive data views, visualizations, and dashboards powered by structured filtering and unstructured search to enable users to get to answers more quickly. Diverse user needs are supported by a variety of data visualization types, such as simple line and bar charts, purpose-built geospatial and time series visualizations, tree diagrams, network diagrams, heatmaps, scatter plots, and histograms.

- Incorporation of advanced analytics and machine learning from Elasticsearch. Kibana's query, filtering, and data summarization capabilities reflect Elasticsearch's powerful query domain specific language and aggregation framework while making it interactive.
- Management of the Elastic Stack. Kibana presents a broad user interface showing the health of Elastic Stack components and provides cluster alerts to notify administrators of problems. Its central management user interfaces make it easier to operate the Elastic Stack at scale.
- Home for solutions. Kibana is where our users and customers access the user interfaces for our Search, Observability, and Security solutions. Kibana provides core services, like security, alerting, and data visualization components. This makes it easy for users to discover all of the capabilities our solutions provide and enables solution users to benefit from Kibana's core capabilities.
- Application framework. Kibana is designed to be extensible. Users interested in a highly specialized visualization type not distributed with Kibana by default can customize experiences through a Kibana plugin and make the plugin available to the community. Dozens of Kibana plugins have been shared by the community via Elastic documentation and code sharing platforms such as GitHub.

Elastic Agent, Beats, and Logstash are data ingestion tools that enable users to collect and enrich any kind of data from any source for storage in Elasticsearch. Beats and Logstash have an extensible modular architecture. Elastic Agent is a single, unified way to add monitoring for logs, metrics, and other types of data to each host, and also includes integrated host protection and central management. Beats are lightweight agents purpose-built for collecting data on devices, servers, and inside containers. Key features include the following:

- Data shippers. Elastic Agent introduces a new single agent architecture across hosts that simplifies management and deployment. Elastic Agent is based on the architecture of Beats, lightweight agents built for the purposes of efficient data collection at the edge for specific types of data, such as Filebeat for the collection of logging data, Metricbeat for the collection of system or service metric data, Auditbeat for the collection of security data, Packetbeat for the collection of network data, and Heartbeat for the collection of availability data. Dozens of community Beats enable the collection of data from specialized sources.
- Extensibility and community Beats. The Beats platform enables rapid creation of custom Beats that can be run on a variety of edge technologies for data collection. Over 90 Beats have been shared by the community via Elastic documentation and many more are available through code sharing platforms such as GitHub.
- Host protection. Specifically with Elastic Agent, we extend protection to hosts in addition to data transfer. Elastic Agent stops malware and ransomware and enables environment-wide visibility and advanced threat detection.

Logstash enables centralized collection and extract, transformation, and load capabilities. Key features of Logstash include the following:

- Data transformation engine. Logstash is a centralized data transformation engine that can receive and pull data from multiple sources, transform and filter that data, and send it to multiple outputs. Logstash has a powerful and flexible configuration language that allows users to create data stream acquisition and transformation logic without having to write code. This capability greatly extends and accelerates the ability to create data management pipelines to a wide variety of organizations and individuals.
- Plugins. Logstash collects data from a variety of sources, such as network devices, queues, endpoints, and public cloud services. Logstash enriches the data via lookups against local data sources, such as a geolocation database, and remote data sources, such as relational databases. Logstash can output events to Elasticsearch or downstream queues and other data stores. We develop and support more than 80 plugins for many common integrations.
- Logstash extensibility and community plugins. A vibrant community of users extends our reach through hundreds of community Logstash plugins that enable integration with a wide variety of data sources across many use cases.

Observability combines analysis across the IT ecosystem of IT applications, networks, and infrastructure to deliver actionable insights into performance, availability, usability, adoption, and anomalous behavior.

- Logs. Logs indexes, searches, and analyzes structured and unstructured logs at large scale to monitor the health and performance of an organization's services, infrastructure, and applications. Users can analyze and visualize information extracted from logs to understand system behavior and trends to optimize performance and preemptively address potential issues. By querying logs in ad hoc ways, users can triage, troubleshoot, and resolve performance issues.
- Metrics. Metrics ingests, searches, visualizes, and analyzes numeric and time series data from IT systems, including applications, data stores, hosts, containers, cloud infrastructure, and more. Users can review performance and utilization trends to optimize and plan for future needs. Metrics helps users deliver on infrastructure service level objectives ('SLO'), and resolve downtime or performance issues by understanding how the state of individual components fits into the bigger picture.
- Events. Events allow users to monitor and respond to real-time operational happenings, ranging from security incidents to application-specific events. By providing a chronological view of what is happening across their infrastructure, users can identify patterns or anomalies that could signify more significant issues. Event data can also be correlated with logs and metrics to give a more comprehensive overview of system health and performance, facilitating faster root cause analysis and proactive management of operational risks.
- APM. APM delivers insight into application performance at the code level. Developers can instrument apps and see the lifecycle of a transaction across services from front end to back end. This can give developers confidence in the code they ship, and can give operational teams visibility into code-level errors and performance bottlenecks to accelerate root cause analysis and resolution during an investigation.
- Synthetic Monitoring. Customers and users leverage Synthetic Monitoring to track and monitor the availability of the hosts, websites, services, and application endpoints that support business operations. Through proactive monitoring, customers can detect troublesome components before they are reported by end users.

Security delivers unified protection to prevent, detect, and respond to a variety of threats across the IT ecosystem.

- SIEM. Elastic SIEM automates threat detection and remediation, reducing mean time to detect ('MTTD') and mean time to respond ('MTTR'). With prebuilt Elastic Agent and Beats integrations, SIEM can ingest data from cloud, network, endpoints, applications, and other systems. With Elastic Common Schema ('ECS'), users can centrally analyze information like logs, flows, and contextual data from disparate data sources. SIEM provides an interactive workspace for security teams to detect and respond to threats. Teams can triage events and perform investigations, gathering evidence on an interactive timeline. SIEM also streamlines opening and updating cases, forwarding potential incidents to security operations workflows and IT ticketing systems.
- Endpoint Security. Endpoint Security combines prevention, detection, and response into a single, autonomous agent that can run even in isolated environments. It is designed for ease of use and for speed, and can help stop threats in early stages of an attack. Endpoint Security includes protection against ransomware, malware, phishing, exploits, fileless attacks, and other cybersecurity threats.
- XDR. Extended Detection and Response ('XDR') extends detection and response across the entire attack surface. When deployed together, SIEM and Endpoint Security provide a strong security posture with broad visibility on potential threats. XDR delivers a unified security stack, protecting across endpoints, cloud, and the broader environment, letting customers minimize

vendor sprawl, harness actionable data, and provide defense in depth to minimize time to resolution.

## Competition

Our market is highly competitive, quickly evolving, fragmented, and subject to rapid changes in technology, shifting customer needs, and frequent introductions of new offerings. Our principal competitors include:

- For Search and other platform use cases: offerings such as Lucidworks Fusion and Apache Solr (open source offering), search tools including Algolia, Coveo, and Google.
- For Observability: software vendors with specific observability solutions to analyze logging data, metrics, APM data, or infrastructure uptime, such as AppDynamics (owned by Cisco Systems), Datadog, Dynatrace, New Relic, and Splunk (owned by Cisco Systems).
- For Security: security vendors such as Azure Sentinel (by Microsoft), Broadcom (which owns Carbon Black and Symantec), CrowdStrike, McAfee, and Splunk (owned by Cisco Systems).
- Certain cloud hosting providers and managed service providers, including AWS, that offer products or services based on a forked version of the Elastic Stack. These offerings are not supported by Elastic and come without any of Elastic's proprietary features, whether free or paid.

The principal competitive factors for companies in our industry are:

- product capabilities, including speed, scale, and relevance, with which to power search AI experiences;
- an extensible product 'stack' that enables developers to build a wide variety of solutions;
- powerful and flexible technology that can manage a broad variety and large volume of data;
- ease of deployment and ease of use;

## Environmental, Social and Governance Matters

In our environmental, social, and governance ('ESG') efforts, we seek to address relevant societal challenges with transparency and accountability to make a positive impact on our employees, customers, and society at large. We measure our progress against the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) standards for the Software and IT Services industry, select United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), with a focus on ESGrelated impacts, risks, and opportunities. We organize our efforts around four core ESG pillars: social impact, governance, environmental impact, and our products' societal impact. We believe that operating Elastic in an environmentally and socially responsible manner, while employing principled, effective, and transparent governance practices, will help drive sustainable long-term value for all of our stakeholders, including our shareholders, employees, customers, creditors, and communities.

## ESG Oversight

At the board of directors level, our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is tasked with oversight for our sustainability and ESG activities, programs, and disclosures. Additionally, we have established an ESG steering committee consisting of several senior executives with responsibility for functional areas covering our ESG activities. The ESG steering committee's responsibility is to provide strategic direction and applicable approvals to our cross-functional ESG working group, which implements ESG initiatives throughout Elastic and contributes to developing ESG disclosures. The ESG steering committee also provides updates to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board.

## Environment

We believe that environmentally responsible operating practices are important to generating value for our stakeholders, being a good partner to our customers, and being a good employer to our employees.

As a company that's distributed by design, we operate with a relatively low office energy use footprint compared to companies with a traditional in-office workforce. We aim to maintain a low in-office people-todesk ratio, which helps to minimize employee commuting, office energy and water consumption, and waste generation. We are also focused on managing greenhouse gas emissions in order to do our part to help ensure a more stable and secure future. We are thinking beyond our own direct impact and addressing the largest sources of impact within our supply chain.

While we do have physical office spaces throughout the world, we strive to limit the amount of space used to what is necessary to support our operations globally. Further, our workplace team runs several in-office initiatives with the aim to reduce our environmental impacts on a daily basis, including plastic water bottle removal, packaging reduction, in-office recycling, bio-waste reduction and water management.

We do not have our own data centers. Instead, for Elastic Cloud offerings, we strategically partner with leading cloud service providers, including Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. These industry leaders are committed to minimizing the environmental impact of their global cloud platforms.

## Social Impact Human Capital Management

We believe that our employees (whom we call 'Elasticians') and our culture are vital to Elastic's long-term success. We support both with human capital management efforts focused on:

- Attracting, engaging and retaining a talented and diverse employee base
- Maintaining our strong company culture
- Enhancing our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion ('DEI')
- Facilitating strong employee engagement
- Promoting continuous employee learning and development
- Providing a comprehensive total rewards package that seeks to offer fair and consistent pay practices with an emphasis on employee well-being

Our management regularly updates our board of directors and its committees on human capital trends and employee-focused activities and initiatives.

As of April 30, 2024, we had a total of 3,187 employees in over 35 countries globally. Over 30% of our workforce consists of women and employees who self-identify as non-binary. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. In certain countries, we have works councils or follow statutory requirements for employee representation through industry-wide collective bargaining agreements.

## Distributed Workforce

Elastic originated as a distributed company and continues to be distributed by design. We have built our processes, systems, and teams so that employees can generally perform their jobs without needing to be physically present in the same room - or even in the same time zone - as their colleagues. Just as distributed systems are more resilient, we believe that a distributed workforce helps build a strong company that can scale and adapt as new challenges arise. Our distributed model also expands our reach to a global candidate pool, broadening our ability to attract diverse talent across regions.

## Diversity, Equity and Inclusion

Our focus on DEI is critical to how we develop, strengthen and sustain a sense of belonging and inclusion among all employees.

- Balanced Teams. We strive to be an employer of choice for a diverse and inclusive workforce through our talent brand, talent attraction, development, and retention efforts. Our recruiting approach is underpinned by the desire to create balanced teams at Elastic, which includes considering broad aspects of diversity - not only race and gender, but also diversity of thought, experience and tenure. We believe in empowering our employees to be their whole, creative selves and are proud to see this work recognized by Comparably, a workplace culture and compensation review platform, in nine major categories of its 2023 Best Place to Work series, including: Best Company Culture, Best CEO for Diversity, and Best Company Work-Life Balance. We also received an A+ culture score from Comparably.
- Elastician Resource Groups. We strive to embed DEI deep within our culture through various initiatives, projects, and programs, the centerpiece of which is our Elastician Resource Groups

('ERGs'), which are company-sponsored, self-organized, employee-run groups aligned with specific shared identities, interests, affinity or allyship. Our seven ERGs encompass: Accessibility, Black and African American, Asian and Pacific Islander+, Hispanic/Latinx, LGBTQIA+, Military/ Veteran, and Women.

- Fair Pay Practices. Fair pay is the foundation of our compensation philosophy and the goal of fair pay informs our pay decisions around the globe. This means paying people fairly for the job they perform without regard to gender, race, or ethnicity. We partner with an external firm to conduct pay equity analysis on a regular basis using established job groupings and control factors to promote appropriate comparisons. We look at gender globally and race and ethnicity for employees in the U.S. Additionally, outside of the United States, we conduct supplemental country-specific analysis in accordance with local requirements. Further recognizing that transparency is fundamental in fostering an equitable workplace where employees can trust that their compensation is based on fair and objective criteria, we provide all employees with information about the full salary range for their role. Throughout the United States and Canada, we also include salary ranges on all job postings, in all states and provinces.
- Code of Conduct . To promote and reinforce our high standards of ethics and integrity throughout the entire company, we require all employees to acknowledge their compliance with our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and complete mandatory training on this code, and on whistleblowing, anti-harassment, discrimination, anti-retaliation, and other key policies and standards.

## Employee Engagement

We are committed to ensuring that our employees have a voice and the opportunity to share their ideas and insights. Through their collective experiences and feedback, our employees play a key role in enhancing our workplace environment.

We formally seek employee feedback through regular employee experience surveys. We monitor employee morale and attitudes through two primary feedback mechanisms, consisting of - an annual employee engagement survey and a mid-year pulse survey check-in. In fiscal 2024, our employees demonstrated high engagement with robust participation in the employee experience survey. The results of these surveys are reviewed at the company, functional, team, and manager level, and are used to develop action plans.

## Learning and Development

Elastic's Learning &amp; Organizational Development (L&amp;OD) team's vision is to enable purposeful growth for all employees by providing meaningful learning that can be applied in work and life. Our L&amp;OD team's mission is to enable employees by providing the opportunity to pursue their purpose, in work and life. To that end, we engage across a variety of mediums to ways in which we support the continuous learning and development of all Elasticians, including anytime access to on-demand video based learning and other opportunities.

We also conduct specific programs to develop managers and leaders at Elastic, including an externally-led leadership development program focused on high-performing leaders who possess the potential to have a significant strategic impact on the achievement of our long-term objectives.

## Total Rewards

- Compensation, Benefits and Well-being . We aim to provide all employees with a total rewards package that is market-competitive, emphasizing global consistency and local relevance. Compensation typically includes equity in the form of restricted stock units in addition to cash. Reflecting our interest in the whole person, we provide benefit programs designed to enable employees to meet their well-being goals, from starting a family to being at their physical and emotional best. These programs generally include core offerings of healthcare coverage and income protection plans, along with a focus on mental health and well-being. We provide marketcompetitive paid time off programs, which feature 16 weeks of paid leave to all new parents, along with life-planning benefits. In addition, we provide retirement savings plans, including a companymatched 401k plan for our U.S.-based employees. Outside of the United States, we offer plans aligned to local market practice. We also have adopted an employee stock purchase plan in which employees in certain countries are able to participate.
- Flexible Work Environment . As a distributed company, most employees have the flexibility to work anywhere provided that we have an established structure and it aligns with the needs of the business and their role. We also recognize the importance of face-to-face interaction and maintain physical offices around the world to provide a space for employees to work and collaborate in a manner that fits their needs and preferences.
- Community Involvement. Through our Elastic Cares program, employees can support the charitable organizations that matter most to them on a local and global level. This program encompasses donation matching, our nonprofit organization program which provides our technology for free to certain nonprofit organizations, and our volunteer time off initiative. Employees are encouraged to volunteer throughout the year with nonprofit organizations of their

choosing using our volunteer time-off program, which provides our employees with 40 hours of paid volunteer time each year. Employees who volunteer outside of their scheduled work day can also log their hours to earn donation credit which they can direct back to the cause of their choice.

## Government Regulations

Our worldwide business activities are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations. Our compliance with existing or future governmental regulations, including, but not limited to, those pertaining to global trade, business acquisitions, consumer and data protection, and taxes, could have material impacts on our business. See the section titled "Risk Management and Risk Factors" included elsewhere in this Report for a discussion of these potential impacts.

## Governance

## Corporate Governance Practices and Policies

We believe it is the duty of the board of directors to serve our shareholders and our other stakeholders in overseeing the management of the Company's business. To fulfill its responsibilities, the board of directors is guided by the procedures and standards set forth in our corporate governance guidelines, board rules, Code of Conduct and other governance policies. We conduct mandatory training for employees with respect to our Code of Conduct and other significant compliance policies. We also maintain an ethics hotline where employees and third parties can confidentially report any concerns about possible violations of our Code of Conduct and compliance policies. We investigate compliance-related reports we receive through the hotline or other reporting channels and take appropriate remedial action when warranted. You can find certain of our governance documents, compliance policies, and our ethics hotline on our website at www.elastic.co.

Our efforts for effective corporate governance are supported by the following practices and policies:

- All of our non-executive continuing directors and director nominees standing for appointment at the Annual Meeting are independent under the rules of the NYSE.
- The Chairperson of our board of directors is independent.
- Our board of directors has both a Lead Independent Director and a Vice-Chairperson, both of whom are independent.
- All of our board committees are composed solely of independent directors.
- The functioning of our board of directors and board committees, including the leadership structure of our board of directors, is evaluated at least annually.
- Our key corporate governance and compliance policies are reviewed regularly.
- Our board of directors and its committees may hire outside advisors independent of management.
- Our insider trading policy contains anti-hedging and anti-pledging provisions.
- Our share ownership policy contains ownership requirements aimed to align the interests of our directors and senior management with the interests of long-term stakeholders.

## Privacy and Information Security

We are committed to the highest ethical standards and strive to comply with all applicable laws and safeguard all data entrusted to us. Elastic's privacy and security program leverages technology and robust governance practices in an effort to protect data. We have dedicated teams that include our director of privacy and privacy and compliance counsel, our chief information security officer, and experienced security operations teams. We invest in technical, organizational, and administrative measures throughout our infrastructure, including our cloud offerings, to protect the data entrusted to us. Elastic's program includes transparency, physical and logical controls, vulnerability monitoring, data availability, supply-chain risk management and a legal compliance framework designed to address applicable laws and regulations relating to privacy and information security.

## Vendor Code of Conduct

Our commitment to responsibly managing and partnering with our suppliers is embodied in our Global Vendor Code of Conduct ('GVCC'), which applies to all suppliers of products or services to Elastic. Through the GVCC, we seek to require our suppliers to operate with honesty and integrity and comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including the same standards we have set for ourselves for complying with human rights and labor laws and standards.

## Shareholder Engagement

We value our shareholders' opinions and feedback and are committed to maintaining an active dialogue to understand their priorities and concerns. We believe that ongoing engagement builds mutual trust and alignment with our shareholders and is essential to our long-term success.

We consider our history of actively engaging with and listening to our shareholders, and regularly providing shareholders with opportunities to deliver feedback through our shareholder engagement program, a vital part of our overall corporate governance program and a source of long-term value. Our Investor Relations team, often with participation by our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as well as other business leaders, regularly meets with investors, prospective investors, and investment analysts. Our Investor Relations team regularly communicates topics discussed with shareholders and shareholder feedback to senior management, which in turn is discussed with our board of directors. We believe that our approach to engaging directly and openly with our shareholders drives increased corporate accountability, improves decision making, and ultimately helps create sustainable long-term value for our stakeholders.

In fiscal year 2024, we engaged with institutional shareholders to discuss a variety of topics, including:

- business strategy;
- financial performance;
- technology initiatives and product innovation;
- corporate governance;
- executive and director compensation;
- human capital and talent;
- diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives;
- environmental policy and sustainability, including board oversight of ESG matters; and
- board composition.

## Product Societal Impact

Elastic, the Search AI Company, is committed to building products that create a positive societal impact. The Elastic Search AI Platform ('our platform'), combines the power of search with AI to help companies solve real-time business problems, unlock potential value, and achieve better outcomes. Our platform, available as both a hosted, managed service across public clouds as well as self-managed software, allows our customers to find insights and drive AI and machine learning use cases from large amounts of data. The company's open-source roots allow Elastic to provide its solutions to a large community of users for free. This encourages innovation and efficiency to operate at scale for both non-profit organizations and for-profit customers. We believe Elastic's solutions have allowed our customers to positively impact society in various ways, including but not limited to enabling human security and combating trafficking, reducing carbon footprint, and providing energy-savings through efficient and reduced power consumption.

## Elastic Community Engagement

At Elastic, community matters. We recognize that our team extends beyond our employees to our community of users, which includes all the users who download our software. Our users interact with us on our website and forums and on X (formerly known as Twitter), GitHub, Stack Overflow, LinkedIn, Facebook, Slack, Reddit, Instagram, YouTube, and more. To build products that best meet our users' needs, we focus on, and invest in, continuing to build a strong community. Each download of the Elastic Stack is a new opportunity to educate our next contributor, hear about a new use case, explore the need for a new feature, or meet a future member of the team.

To recognize the contributions of our community members, we have an Elastic Contributor Program to recognize the hard work of our valued contributors, encourage knowledge sharing within the Elastic community and build friendly competition around contributions. Through programs such as the Elastic Contributor Program and Elastic Excellence Awards, we aim to acknowledge our valued community members.

## Legal Proceedings

From time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, including patent, commercial, product liability, employment, class action, whistleblower and other litigation and claims, as well as governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings. In addition, third parties from time to time may assert claims against us in the form of letters and other communications. We are not currently a party to any legal proceedings that, if determined adversely to us, would individually or taken together, in our opinion, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Future litigation may be necessary to defend ourselves, our

partners and our customers by determining the scope, enforceability and validity of third-party proprietary rights, or to establish our proprietary rights. The results of any current or future litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and regardless of the outcome, such litigation could have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors.

## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Report. As discussed in the section titled 'Forward-Looking Statements,' the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such difference include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section titled 'Risk Management and Risk Factors' included elsewhere in this Report. Our fiscal year end is April 30.

## Overview

Elastic, the Search AI Company, enables our customers to find the answers they need in real time, using all of their data, at scale. Our platform, combines the power of search with AI to help companies solve real-time business problems, unlock potential value, and achieve better outcomes. Our platform, available as both a hosted, managed service across public clouds as well as self-managed software, allows our customers to find insights and drive AI and machine learning use cases from large amounts of data.

We offer three search-powered solutions - Search, Observability, and Security - that are built on the platform. We help organizations, their employees, and their customers find what they need faster, while keeping mission-critical applications running smoothly, and protecting against cyber threats.

Our platform is built on the Elastic Stack, a powerful set of software products that ingest data from any source, in any format, and perform search, analysis, and visualization of that data. At the core of the Elastic Stack is Elasticsearch - a highly scalable document store and search engine, and the unified data store for all of our solutions and use cases. Our platform also includes the ESRE, which combines advanced AI with Elastic's text search to give developers a full suite of sophisticated retrieval algorithms and the ability to integrate with large language models. The Elastic Stack can be used by developers and IT decision makers to power a variety of use cases. It is a distributed, real-time vector search and analytics engine and data store for all types of data, including textual, numerical, geospatial, structured, and unstructured.

We make our platform available as a hosted, managed service across major cloud providers. Customers can also deploy our platform across hybrid clouds, public or private clouds, and multi-cloud environments. As digital transformation drives mission-critical business functions to the cloud, we believe that every company must incorporate search AI capabilities across IT and line-of-business organizations to find the answers that matter from all of its data in real-time and at scale.

Our business model is based primarily on a combination of a paid Elastic-managed hosted service offering and paid and free proprietary self-managed software. Our paid offerings for our platform are sold via subscription through resource-based pricing, and all customers and users have access to varying levels of features across all solutions. In Elastic Cloud, our family of cloud-based offerings, we offer various subscription tiers tied to different features. For users who download our software, we make some of the features of our software available free of charge, allowing us to engage with a broad community of developers and practitioners and introduce them to the value of the Elastic Stack. We believe in the importance of an open software development model, and we develop the majority of our software in public repositories as open code under a proprietary license. Unlike some companies, we do not build an enterprise version that is separate from our free distribution. We maintain a single code base across both our selfmanaged software and Elastic-hosted services. All of these actions help us build a powerful commercial business model that we believe is optimized for product-driven growth.

We generate revenue primarily from sales of subscriptions to our platform. We offer various paid subscription tiers that provide different levels of rights to use proprietary features and access to support. We do not sell support separately. Our subscription agreements typically range from one to three years and are usually billed annually in advance. Our subscription agreements are both term-based and consumption-based, with the vast majority of Elastic Cloud subscriptions being consumption-based. We sell subscriptions in various currencies, with the majority of our subscriptions contracted in U.S. dollars, and a smaller portion contracted in Euro, British Pound Sterling, and other currencies. Elastic Cloud customers may also purchase subscriptions on a month-to-month basis without a commitment, with usage billed at the end of each month. Subscriptions accounted for 93% and 92% of total revenue for the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We also generate revenue from consulting and training services.

We make it easy for users to begin using our products in order to drive rapid adoption. Users can either sign up for a free trial on Elastic Cloud or download our software directly from our website without any sales interaction, and immediately begin using the full set of features. Users can also sign up for Elastic Cloud through public cloud marketplaces. We conduct low-touch campaigns to keep users and customers engaged once they have begun using Elastic Cloud or have downloaded our software. As of April 30, 2024, we had approximately 21,000 customers compared to approximately 20,200 customers as of April 30, 2023. The majority of our new customers use Elastic Cloud. We define a customer as an entity that generated revenue in the quarter ending on the measurement date from an annual or month-to-month subscription. Affiliated entities are typically counted as a single customer.

Many of these customers start with limited initial spending on our products but can significantly increase their spending over time. We drive high-touch engagement with qualified prospects and customers to drive further awareness, adoption, and expansion of our products with paid subscriptions. Expansion includes increasing the number of developers and practitioners using our products, increasing the utilization of our products for a particular use case, and utilizing our products to address new use cases. The number of customers who represented greater than $100,000 in annual contract value ('ACV') was over 1,330 and over 1,160 as of April 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The ACV of a customer's commitments is calculated based on the terms of that customer's subscriptions, and represents the total committed annual subscription amount as of the measurement date. Month-to-month subscriptions are not included in the calculation of ACV.

Our sales teams are organized primarily by geography and secondarily by customer segments. They focus on both seeking to obtain new customers and on pursuing additional sales to existing customers. In addition to our direct sales efforts, we also maintain partnerships to further extend our reach and awareness of our products around the world.

We have experienced significant growth, with revenue increasing to $1.267 billion for the year ended April 30, 2024 from $1.069 billion for the year ended April 30, 2023, representing year-over-year growth of 19% for the year ended April 30, 2024. For the year ended April 30, 2024, revenue from outside the Netherlands accounted for 97% of our total revenue.

We generated net income of $59.2 million for the year ended April 30, 2024 and incurred a net loss of $276.1 million for the year ended April 30, 2023. Our net cash provided by operating activities was $134.7 million and $30.9 million for the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We had an accumulated deficit of $1.147 billion as of April 30, 2024 due to losses in all prior years. We may incur net losses in the future and there can be no assurance whether, or when, we may become profitable on a consistent basis.

We continue to make substantial investments in developing the Elastic Stack and expanding our global sales and marketing footprint. With a distributed team spanning over 35 countries, we are able to recruit, hire, and retain high-quality, experienced technical and sales personnel and operate at a rapid pace to drive product releases, fix bugs, and create and market new products. We had 3,187 employees as of April 30, 2024.

## Current Economic Conditions

Macroeconomic events, including continued inflation, slower economic growth, and political unrest, continue to evolve and negatively impact worldwide economic activity. Governmental and corporate responses to these factors, including rising interest rates, unpredictable and decreased spending, and layoffs, have added to the highly volatile macroeconomic landscape. We have experienced and, if economic conditions do not reflect a sustained recovery, we may continue to experience longer and more unpredictable sales cycles, increased scrutiny of deals, slowing consumption and overall customer expenditures, and the impacts of changing foreign exchange rates with a strengthening or weakening U.S. dollar. We continue to closely monitor the macroeconomic environment and its effects on our business and on global economic activity, including customer spending behavior. See the section titled "Risk Management and Risk Factors" for a discussion of additional risks.

## Restructuring

During the three months ended April 30, 2024, we initiated a plan to realign business and strategic priorities which resulted in a reduction of our workforce. In connection with this plan, we incurred a charge of $4.2 million primarily consisting of employee-related severance and termination benefits during the three months ended April 30, 2024. The execution of this plan is expected to be substantially completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2025.

On November 30, 2022, we announced and began implementing a plan to align our investments more closely with our strategic priorities by reducing our workforce by approximately 13% and implementing certain facilities-related cost optimization actions. In connection with this restructuring plan, we recorded $0.7 million and $31.8 million of restructuring and other related charges during the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The execution of this restructuring plan was completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2024.

See Note 17 "Restructuring and other related charges" for additional information. See the section titled "Risk Management and Risk Factors" included in this Report for a discussion of risks.

## Key Factors Affecting Our Performance

We believe that the growth and future success of our business depends on many factors, including those described below. While each of these factors presents significant opportunities for our business, they also pose important challenges that we must successfully address in order to sustain our growth and improve our results of operations.

Increasing adoption of Elastic Cloud. Elastic Cloud, our family of cloud-based offerings, is an important growth opportunity for our business. Organizations are increasingly looking for hosted deployment alternatives with reduced administrative burdens. In some cases, users of our source available software that have been self-managing deployments of the Elastic Stack subsequently become paying subscribers of Elastic Cloud. For the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, Elastic Cloud contributed 43% and 40% of our total revenue, respectively. We believe that offering Elastic Cloud is important for achieving our long-term growth potential, and we expect Elastic Cloud's contribution to our subscription revenue to continue to increase over time. However, we expect that an increase in the relative contribution of Elastic Cloud to our business will continue to have a modest adverse impact on our gross margin as a result of the associated third-party hosting costs.

Growing the Elastic community. Our strategy consists of providing access to source available software, on both a paid and free-of-charge basis, and fostering a community of users and developers. Our strategy is designed to pursue what we believe to be significant untapped potential for the use of our technology. After developers begin to use our software and start to participate in our developer community, they become more likely to apply our technology to additional use cases and promote our technology within their organizations. This reduces the time required for our sales force to educate potential customers on our solutions. To capitalize on our opportunity, we intend to make further investments to keep the Elastic Stack accessible and well known to software developers around the world. We intend to continue to invest in our products and support and engage our user base and developer community through content, events, and conferences in the United States and internationally. Our results of operations may fluctuate as we make these investments.

Developing new features for the Elastic Stack. The Elastic Stack is applied to various use cases by customers, including through the solutions we offer. Our revenue is derived primarily from subscriptions of Search, Observability and Security built into the Elastic Stack. We believe that releasing additional features of the Elastic Stack, including our solutions, drives usage of our products and ultimately drives our growth. To that end, we plan to continue to invest in building new features and solutions that expand the capabilities of the Elastic Stack. These investments may adversely affect our operating results prior to generating benefits, to the extent that they ultimately generate benefits at all.

Growing our customer base by converting users of our software to paid subscribers. Our financial performance depends on growing our paid customer base by converting free users of our software into paid subscribers. Our distribution model has resulted in rapid adoption by developers around the world. We have invested, and expect to continue to invest, heavily in sales and marketing efforts to convert additional free users to paid subscribers. Our investment in sales and marketing is significant given our large and diverse user base. These investments are likely to occur before we realize the anticipated benefits of such investments, such that they may adversely affect our operating results in the near term.

Expanding within our current customer base. Our future growth and profitability depend on our ability to drive additional sales to existing customers. Customers often expand the use of our software within their organizations by increasing the number of developers using our products, increasing the utilization of our products for a particular use case, and expanding use of our products to additional use cases. We focus some of our direct sales efforts on encouraging these types of expansion within our customer base.

We believe that a useful indication of how our customer relationships have expanded over time is through our Net Expansion Rate, which is based upon trends in the rate at which customers increase their spend with us. To calculate an expansion rate as of the end of a given month, we start with the annualized spend from all such customers as of twelve months prior to that month end, or Prior Period Value. A customer's annualized spend is measured as its ACV, or in the case of customers charged on usage-based arrangements, by annualizing the usage for that month. We then calculate the annualized spend from these same customers as of the given month end, or Current Period Value, which includes any growth in the value of their subscriptions or usage and is net of contraction or attrition over the prior twelve months. We then divide the Current Period Value by the Prior Period Value to arrive at an expansion rate. The Net Expansion Rate at the end of any period is the weighted average of the expansion rates as of the end of each of the trailing twelve months. The Net Expansion Rate includes the dollar-weighted value of our subscriptions or usage that expand, renew, contract, or experience attrition. For instance, if each customer had a one-year subscription and renewed its subscription for the same amount, the Net Expansion Rate would be 100%. Customers who reduced their annual subscription dollar value (contraction) or did not renew their annual subscription (attrition) would adversely affect the Net Expansion Rate. Our Net Expansion Rate was approximately 110% as of April 30, 2024.

As large organizations expand their use of the Elastic Stack across multiple use cases, projects, divisions and users, they often begin to require centralized provisioning, management and monitoring across multiple deployments. To satisfy these requirements, our Enterprise subscription tier provides access to key orchestration and deployment management capabilities. We will continue to focus some of our direct sales efforts on driving adoption of our paid offerings.

## Financial Results

## Revenue

Subscription. Our revenue is primarily generated through the sale of subscriptions to software, which is either self-managed by the user or hosted and managed by us in the cloud. Subscriptions provide the right to use paid proprietary software features and access to support for our paid and unpaid software. Our subscription agreements are either term-based or consumption-based, with the vast majority of Elastic Cloud subscriptions being consumption-based.

A portion of the revenue from self-managed subscriptions is generally recognized up front at the point in time when the license is delivered and the remainder is recognized ratably over the subscription term. Revenue from subscriptions that require access to the cloud or that are hosted and managed by us is recognized ratably over the subscription term or on a usage basis for consumption-based arrangements. Both are presented within Subscription revenue in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).

Services. Services is composed of implementation and other consulting services as well as public and private training. Revenue for services is recognized as these services are delivered.

## Cost of Revenue

Subscription. Cost of subscription consists primarily of personnel and related costs for employees associated with supporting our subscription arrangements, certain third-party expenses, and amortization of certain intangible and other assets. Personnel and related costs comprise cash compensation, benefits and stock-based compensation to employees, costs of third-party contractors, and allocated overhead costs. Third-party expenses consist of cloud hosting costs and other expenses directly associated with our customer support. We expect our cost of subscription to increase in absolute dollars as our subscription revenue increases.

Services. Cost of services revenue consists primarily of personnel costs directly associated with delivery of training, implementation and other services, costs of third-party contractors, facility rental charges and allocated overhead costs. We expect our cost of services to increase in absolute dollars as we invest in our business and as services revenue increases.

Gross profit and gross margin. Gross profit represents revenue less cost of revenue. Gross margin, or gross profit as a percentage of revenue, has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including the timing of our acquisition of new customers and our renewals with existing customers, the average sales price of our subscriptions and services, the amount of our revenue represented by hosted services, the mix of subscriptions sold, the mix of revenue between subscriptions and services, the mix of services between consulting and training, transaction volume growth and support case volume growth. We expect our gross margin to fluctuate over time depending on the factors described above. We expect our revenue from Elastic Cloud to continue to increase as a percentage of total revenue, which we expect will continue to have a modest unfavorable impact on our gross margin as a result of the associated third-party hosting costs.

## Operating Costs

Research and development. Research and development expense primarily consists of personnel and related costs and allocated overhead costs. We expect our research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as we continue to develop new technology and invest further in our existing products.

Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing expense primarily consists of personnel and related costs, commissions, allocated overhead costs and costs related to marketing programs and user events. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, brand-building and customer acquisition and retention activities. We expect our sales and marketing expense to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our sales force and increase our investments in marketing resources. We capitalize sales commissions and associated payroll taxes paid to internal sales personnel that are related to the acquisition of certain customer contracts. Deferred contract acquisition costs are amortized over the expected benefit period.

General and administrative. General and administrative expense primarily consists of personnel and related costs for our management, finance, legal, human resources, and other administrative employees. Our general and administrative expense also includes professional fees, accounting fees, audit fees, tax services and legal fees, as well as insurance, allocated overhead costs, and other corporate expenses. We expect our general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars as we increase the size of our general and administrative functions to support the growth of our business.

Restructuring and other related charges. Restructuring and other related charges primarily consist of employee-related severance and other termination benefits as well as lease impairment and other facilitiesrelated charges.

Other Income. Primarily consist of sublease income and other non-operating gains.

## Finance Income and Finance Costs

Finance income primarily comprises interest income on our cash, cash equivalents and certain marketable securities that is recognized using the effective interest method.

Finance costs primarily consist of interest expense on our 4.125% Senior Notes due 2029 and foreign exchange gains and losses.

## Income Tax (Benefit) Expense

Income tax (benefit) expense consists primarily of income taxes related to the Netherlands, U.S. federal and state, and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Our effective tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as tax rates in jurisdictions outside the Netherlands and the relative amounts of income we earn in those jurisdictions, non-deductible stock-based compensation, and one-time tax benefits or charges, including the recognition of certain deferred tax assets in fiscal 2024 which were previously not recognized due to uncertainties over future taxable profits.

Subscription revenue increased by $191.8 million, or 19%, for the year ended April 30, 2024 compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by continued adoption of Elastic Cloud, which grew 29% over the prior year and increased to 43% of total revenue for the year ended April 30, 2024 from 40% for the year ended April 30, 2023.

Services revenue increased by $6.5 million, or 8%, for the year ended April 30, 2024 compared to the prior year. The increase in services revenue was attributable to increased adoption of our services offerings.

Cost of subscription revenue increased by $26.4 million, or 12%, for the year ended April 30, 2024 compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily due to an increase of $24.7 million in cloud infrastructure costs, $1.5 million in other third-party costs, $0.9 million in software and equipment expense, and $0.6 million in intangible assets amortization. These increases were partially offset by a $1.2 million decrease in third-party consulting costs. Total subscription gross margin improved to 79% for the year ended April 30, 2024 compared to 78% for the prior year, primarily due to efficiencies realized in managing our subscription costs relative to revenue growth.

Cost of services revenue increased by $6.9 million, or 9%, for the year ended April 30, 2024 compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily due to increases of $7.6 million in personnel and related costs and $0.4 million in travel costs. These costs were offset by a decrease of $1.1 million in training and facility costs. The increase in personnel and related costs included increases of $4.0 million in salaries and related taxes and $3.2 million in stock-based compensation.

Gross margin for professional services revenue was relatively flat at 5% for the year ended April 30, 2024 compared to the prior year. We continue to make investments in our services organization that we believe will be needed to support our continued growth. Our gross margin for services may fluctuate or decline in the near-term as we seek to expand our services business.

## Operating Costs

Research and development expense increased by $19.8 million, or 6%, for the year ended April 30, 2024 compared to the prior year as we continued to invest in the development of new and existing offerings. Personnel and related costs increased by $13.3 million, while cloud infrastructure costs related to our research and development activities increased by $4.4 million, and travel costs increased by $1.4 million. The increase in personnel and related costs included increases of $13.7 million in salaries and related taxes, $2.0 million in employee benefits expense and $1.7 million in stock-based compensation. These increases were offset in part by decreases of $4.4 million in acquisition-related compensation.

## Sales and marketing

Sales and marketing expense increased by $52.7 million, or 10%, for the year ended April 30, 2024 compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily due to increases of $31.1 million in personnel and related costs, $12.5 million in marketing expenses, and $9.3 million in travel costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $2.7 million in intangible assets amortization. The increase in personnel and related costs included increases of $15.8 million in salaries and related taxes, $9.6 million in commissions expense and $4.1 million in stock-based compensation.

## General and administrative

General and administrative expense increased by $7.0 million, or 4%, for the year ended April 30, 2024 compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily due to increases of $3.7 million in personnel and related costs, $1.8 million in other miscellaneous non-income based taxes, $1.5 million in legal and professional fees and $1.3 million in bad debt expense and allowance for credit losses. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $1.5 million in insurance costs. The increase in personnel and related costs included mainly increases of $4.9 million in salaries and related taxes offset by a decrease of $1.7 million in stock-based compensation.

## Restructuring and other related charges

For the year ended April 30, 2024, we recorded restructuring and other related charges comprising employee-related severance and other termination benefits of approximately $4.9 million. For the year ended April 30, 2023, we recorded restructuring and other related charges comprising employee-related severance and other termination benefits of approximately $23.3 million, facilities-related charges of approximately $6.7 million, and $1.8 million of other restructuring-related charges.

## Other income

Other income was $4.0 million for the year ended April 30, 2024 compared to $13.7 million in the prior year. This decrease was primarily due to a one-time favorable settlement of a legal claim that increased other income by $10.2 million during the year ended April 30, 2023, with no comparable activity during the year ended April 30, 2024.

## Finance Income and Costs

Finance costs increased by $5.7 million, or 20%, for the year ended April 30, 2024 compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily due to net foreign currency transaction losses of $2.7 million and interest expenses of $2.0 million. Finance income increased by $19.6 million for the year ended April 30, 2024 compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $19.6 million in investment income due to new investments in marketable securities and higher interest earned on money market funds.

## Income Tax Benefit (Expense)

|                              | Year Ended April 30,   | Year Ended April 30,   | Change         | Change         |

| Income tax benefit (expense) | $ 197,455              | $ (21,170)             | $ 218,625      | (1,033)%       |

The benefit from income taxes was $197.5 million for the year ended April 30, 2024, compared to a provision for income taxes of $21.2 million for the prior year. Our effective tax rate was 142.8% and (8.3)% for the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our effective tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as tax rates in jurisdictions outside the Netherlands and the relative amounts of income we earn in those jurisdictions and non-deductible stock-based compensation as well as one-time tax benefits or charges. The increase in tax benefit for the year ended April 30, 2024  primarily resulted from the recognition of deferred tax assets of $250.7 million, attributable to the U.S. federal and certain states' unused tax loss carryforwards, partially offset by tax expense resulting from growth in business operations in jurisdictions where we generate taxable income and do not have any available tax credits or net operating losses to offset that income.

## Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of April 30, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaling $1.084 billion. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities consist of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities. We believe that the credit quality of the securities portfolio is strong and diversified among industries and individual issuers.

We have generated significant operating losses from our operations as reflected in our accumulated deficit of $1.147 billion as of April 30, 2024. We have historically incurred, and expect to continue to incur, operating losses and may generate negative cash flows from operations in the future due to the investments we intend to make and, as a result, we may require additional capital resources to execute on our strategic initiatives to grow our business.

We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities and cash from our future operations will be sufficient to fund our operating and capital needs for at least the next 12 months after issuance date, despite the uncertainty in the changing market and macroeconomic conditions. Our assessment of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could vary as a result of, and our future capital requirements, both near-term and long-term, will depend on, many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support our research and development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing of new introductions of solutions or features, and the continuing market acceptance of our solutions and services. We may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services and technologies, including intellectual property rights. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. In July 2021, we issued long-term debt of $575.0 million, represented by our Senior Notes, and we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, or if we cannot expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities because we lack sufficient capital, our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.

The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented:

## Net cash provided by operating activities

Net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended April 30, 2024 was $134.7 million, which resulted from a net income of $59.2 million adjusted for non-cash charges of $154.6 million, a net cash outflow of $29.8 million from changes in operating assets and liabilities, cash paid for income taxes of $24.2 million and cash paid for interest on borrowings of $25.1 million. Non-cash charges consisted of $249.3 million for stock-based compensation expense, $78.5 for amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs, $10.9 million of amortization of right-of-use assets, $19.2 million of depreciation and intangible asset amortization expense, an increase of $27.4 million in income tax liability, and $5.1 million of miscellaneous other items offset by $227.0 million of an increase in deferred taxes and $8.8 million of amortization of premium and accretion of discount on marketable securities, net. The net cash outflow from changes in operating assets and liabilities was the result of an increase in deferred contract acquisition costs of $119.8 million  as our sales commissions increased due to increased business volume, an increase of $67.2 million in trade and other receivables and an increase in prepayments of $27.7 million. These outflows were partially offset by increases in deferred revenue of $134.6 million and trade and other payables of $49.2 million and a decrease in deposits of $1.2 million.

Net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended April 30, 2023 was $30.9 million, which resulted from a net loss of $276.1 million adjusted for non-cash charges of $369.8 million, a net cash outflow of $27.1 million from changes in operating assets and liabilities, cash paid for income taxes of $11.6 million and cash paid for interest on borrowings of $24.1 million. Non-cash charges consisted of $242.3 million for stock-based compensation expense, $68.9 million for amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs, $12.1 million of amortization of right-of-use assets, $21.5 million of depreciation and intangible asset amortization expense, $6.7 million of asset impairment charges, an increase of $17.7 million in income tax liability, and $0.6 million of miscellaneous other items. The net cash outflow from changes in operating assets and liabilities was the result of an increase in deferred contract acquisition costs of $102.0 million as our sales commissions increased due to increased business volume, an increase of $43.7 million in trade and other receivables, an increase in prepayments of $11.5 million and an increase in deposits of $0.3 million. These outflows were partially offset by a $95.6 million increase in deferred revenue, and a net increase of $34.8 million in trade and other payables.

## Net cash used in investing activities

Net cash used in investing activities of $260.1 million during the year ended April 30, 2024 was primarily due to the purchase of marketable securities of $536.8 million, business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $19.1 million, capital expenditures of $3.5 million, and an increase in restricted cash of $0.2 million. These expenditures were offset by cash provided by maturities and redemptions of marketable securities of $271.4 million and interest received of $28.1 million,

Net cash used in investing activities of $255.1 million during the year ended April 30, 2023 was primarily due to the purchase of marketable securities of $270.3 million. In addition, we incurred $2.7 million of capital expenditures during the year. These expenditures were offset by interest received of $17.7 million and an decrease in restricted cash of $0.2 million.

## Net cash provided by financing activities

Net cash provided by financing activities of $26.1 million during the year ended April 30, 2024 was due to the proceeds from stock option exercises of $20.9 million and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan of $19.1 million offset by payment of lease liabilities of $14.0 million.

Net cash provided by financing activities of $4.5 million during the year ended April 30, 2023 was due to the proceeds from stock option exercises of $17.5 million offset by payment of lease liabilities of $12.9 million.

## Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

We did not have, during the periods presented, nor do we currently have any off balance sheet financing arrangements or any relationships with any unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including entities referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, that were established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.

## Events After The Balance Sheet Date

Up until the day of authorization for issuance, there were no events that would have exerted substantial influence on the net assets, financial position or results of operations as of April 30, 2024.

## Risks Related to our Business and Industry

Our business and operations have experienced rapid growth, and if we do not appropriately manage future growth, if any, or are unable to improve our systems and processes, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects may be adversely affected.

We have experienced rapid growth and increased demand for our offerings. Our number of customers has increased significantly over the past several years, with our total number of customers growing from over 2,800 as of April 30, 2017 to approximately 21,000 as of April 30, 2024. The growth and expansion of our business and offerings place a continuous and significant strain on our management, operational, and financial resources. In addition, as customers adopt our technology for an increasing number of use cases, we have had to support more complex commercial relationships. We may not be able to leverage, develop and retain qualified employees effectively enough to maintain our growth plans. We must continue to improve our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems, our relationships with various partners and other third parties, and our ability to manage headcount and processes in an efficient manner to manage our growth effectively. Our failure to do so could result in increased costs, negatively affect our customers' satisfaction with our offerings, and harm our results of operations.

## We have a history of losses and may not be able to achieve profitability or positive operating cash flow on a consistent basis.

We generated a net income of $59.2 million and incurred a net loss of $276.1 million for the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We have incurred losses in all years prior to fiscal 2024 since our inception. As a result, we had an accumulated deficit of $1,146.9 million as of April 30, 2024. Although we had net income of $59.2 million for the year ended April 30, 2024, we expect to incur net losses in future years. We anticipate that our operating expenses will continue to increase substantially in the foreseeable future as we continue to enhance our offerings, broaden our customer base and pursue larger transactions, expand our sales and marketing activities, expand our operations, hire additional employees, and continue to develop our technology. These efforts may prove more expensive than we currently anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenue sufficiently, or at all, to offset these higher expenses. Revenue growth may slow or revenue may decline for a number of reasons, including slowing demand for our offerings, increasing competition, or economic downturns, including as a result of rising rates of inflation and other macroeconomic events. You should not consider our revenue growth in prior periods as indicative of our future performance. Any failure to increase our revenue or grow our business could prevent us from achieving profitability at all or on a consistent basis, which would cause our business, financial condition, and results of operations to suffer. Additionally, although we generated positive operating cash flow in fiscal 2024 and 2023, any failure to grow our business could prevent us from achieving positive operating cash flow on a consistent basis, which could cause our business, financial condition, and results of operations to suffer.

Unfavorable or uncertain conditions in our industry or the global economy or reductions in information technology spending, including as a result of adverse macroeconomic conditions, or the evolving conflict in Israel and Gaza and Russia's war with Ukraine, could limit our ability to grow our business and negatively affect our results of operations.

Our results of operations may vary based on the impact of changes in our industry or the global economy on us or our customers. Current, future, or sustained economic uncertainties or downturns, whether actual or perceived, could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Negative conditions in the general economy both in the United States and in international markets, including conditions resulting from changes in gross domestic product growth, financial and credit market fluctuations, international trade relations, changes in inflation, foreign exchange and interest rate environments, recessionary fears, supply chain constraints, energy costs, political instability, natural catastrophes, warfare, infectious diseases and terrorist attacks, could cause a decrease in business investments by our customers and potential customers, including spending on information technology, and negatively affect the growth of our business. For example, inflation rates recently reached levels not seen in decades and have continued to create economic volatility as governments adjust interest rates in an attempt to manage the inflationary environment, which may further lead to our customers tightening their technology expenditures and investment. Further, the ongoing international political crisis resulting from the evolving conflict in Israel and Gaza and Russia's war with Ukraine could continue to have significant negative macroeconomic consequences, including on the businesses of our customers, which could negatively impact their spending on our offerings. Any further disruptions or other adverse developments, or concerns or rumors about any such events or similar risks, in the financial services industry, both in the U.S. and in international markets, may lead to market-wide liquidity problems and may impact our or our customers' liquidity and, as a result, negatively affect the level of customer spending on our offerings.

As a result of the foregoing conditions, our revenue may be disproportionately affected by longer and more unpredictable sales cycles, delays or reductions in customer consumption or in general information technology spending, and further impacts of changing foreign exchange rates. Further, current and prospective customers may

choose to develop in-house software as an alternative to using our paid products. These factors could increase the amount of customer churn we have experienced recently and further slow consumption and overall customer expenditure. Moreover, competitors may respond to market conditions by lowering prices. If the economic conditions of the general economy or markets in which we operate do not improve, or worsen from present levels, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.

## We may not be successful in our artificial intelligence initiatives, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.

AI presents new risks and challenges that may affect our business. We have made, and expect to continue to make, continued investments to integrate AI and machine learning technology into our offerings, including increasing our technical operations and engineering in these applications. Rapid technological progress in the industry regarding new and emerging AI technologies, such as generative AI, may require additional investment in the development, integration, and maintenance of our product offerings, as well as the development of appropriate technical protections and safeguards to maintain a responsible and ethical AI framework. These requirements may add costs and could increase our expenses as we continue to expand the breadth of use and applications of AI technologies, including generative AI, further into our product offerings, or to address changes to AI technologies, frameworks, or regulations. Additionally, we may incur substantial costs in our sales and marketing efforts to promote and sell our offerings based on AI technologies, including but not limited to branding, product promotion, and demand generation as well as technical training and investments in resources for our sales personnel and partners. Despite such investments in building our product offerings and in sales and marketing, our product offerings may not be adopted by customers. We may not achieve significant revenue directly related to all of our AI-related initiatives for several years, if at all.

Further, AI presents risks, challenges, and unintended consequences that could affect our ability to continue to incorporate the use of AI successfully in our business and solutions in new and novel ways. In addition, given the complex nature of AI technology, we face an evolving regulatory landscape and significant competition from other companies. Competitors may incorporate AI into their products more quickly or more successfully than we do, which could impair our ability to compete effectively and adversely affect our financial results. Data practices by us or others that result in controversy could also impair the acceptance of AI solutions, which could undermine confidence in the decisions, predictions, analysis, or other content that our AI-related initiatives produce. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.

## Social, ethical, and regulatory issues relating to the use of AI and similar evolving technologies in our offerings may result in new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, reputational harm, damage to our competitive position, and liability.

We have invested in and plan to continue to invest in the research and development of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies, including generative AI. We view our continued investment in AI and generative AI research and development as an opportunity to enhance our products and services, strengthen our competitive advantage, and contribute to the responsible advancement of AI and generative AI technology. While we aim to do so in a responsible manner, social, ethical, regulatory, and legal issues relating to the use of new and evolving technologies such as AI and generative AI in our offerings may result in reputational harm and liability, as well as failures in regulatory compliance, and may cause us to incur additional research, development, and compliance costs. We are increasingly building into many of our offerings new software for integrating and creating the opportunity for our customers to integrate themselves as well as existing AI and generative AI tools in the market. As with many innovations, AI and generative AI present risks that could affect its adoption and contribution to our business. If we enable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on society, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm, or legal liability.

Government regulation related to AI and generative AI use and ethics may also increase the burden and cost of research and development, testing, and maintenance and delay implementation of these technologies. The rapid evolution of AI will require the application of resources to develop, test and maintain our products and services to help ensure that AI and generative AI are implemented in a way that minimizes unintended, potentially harmful, or adverse impacts. It is possible that further laws and regulations will be adopted, or that existing laws and regulations may be interpreted, in ways that would affect our business and the ways in which we, our partners, and customers or potential customers use AI and machine learning technology, which may impact their use adoption of our solutions and may adversely affect our financial condition and our results of operations, including as a result of costs we incur to comply with such laws or regulations.

If we experience a security incident, or unauthorized access to or other unauthorized processing of confidential information, including personal data, otherwise occurs, our software may be perceived as not being secure, customers may reduce the use of or stop using our products, and we may incur significant liabilities.

In the normal course of our business, we receive, collect, manage, store, transmit and otherwise process large amounts of proprietary information and confidential data, including personal data and other sensitive information, relating to our operations, products, customers and business partners. Any cybersecurity incident affecting our

networks, systems or those on which we rely could result in our loss of confidential information, including personal data, disruption to our operations, significant remediation costs, lost revenue, increased insurance premiums, damage to our reputation, litigation, regulatory investigations, fines, or other liabilities. We face sophisticated and evolving cyber threats from individual hackers, criminal groups, and state-sponsored organizations, as well as risks that employees, contractors or other insiders, particularly those with connectivity to our systems, may introduce vulnerabilities into our environments, facilitate a cyber attack, or take action to misappropriate our intellectual property and proprietary information.

As a provider of security solutions, we have been and may continue to be specifically targeted by threat actors for attacks intended to circumvent our security capabilities as an entry point into customers' endpoints, networks, or systems. Our industry continues to see a large volume of unauthorized scans of systems searching for vulnerabilities or misconfigurations to exploit. Attempted cyber attacks of our systems can deploy such malicious techniques, among others, as phishing, ransomware, credential stuffing, distributed denial of service, network intrusions, malware, domain name system spoofing, exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities, and structural query language injection. While our security systems and controls have successfully protected us against, and mitigated the impacts of, many past attacks of this nature, we expect that we will experience similar incidents in the future.

If our security measures are compromised, we may face a loss in intellectual property protection, our data, or our customers' data, and our reputation may be damaged, our business may suffer, and we could be subject to claims, demands, regulatory investigations, and other proceedings and indemnity obligations and otherwise incur significant liability. Even the perception of inadequate security or an inability to maintain security certifications, maintain a security program in line with industry standards, or to comply with our customer or user agreements, contracts with third-party vendors or service providers or other contracts may damage our reputation, cause a loss of confidence in our security solutions and negatively affect our ability to win new customers and retain existing customers. Further, we could be required to expend significant capital and other resources to address any security incident, and we may face difficulties or delays in identifying and responding to any cybersecurity incident. If our systems or networks or those on which we rely suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we could experience delays in reporting our financial results, and we may lose revenue and profits as a result of our inability to timely produce, distribute, invoice and collect payments for our products and services.

In addition, many of our customers may use our software for processing their confidential information, including business strategies, financial and operational data, personal information and other related data. As a result, unauthorized access to or use of our software or such data could result in the loss, compromise, corruption or destruction of our customers' confidential information. Such access or use could also hinder our ability to obtain and maintain information security certifications that support customers' adoption of our products and our retention of those customers. We expect to continue incurring significant costs in connection with our implementation of administrative, technical and physical measures designed to protect the integrity of our customers' data and prevent data loss, misappropriation and other security incidents.

We engage third-party vendors and service providers to store and otherwise process some of our and our customers' data, including sensitive and personal information. There have been and may continue to be significant supply chain attacks generally, and our third-party vendors and service providers may be targeted or affected by such attacks and other efforts to exploit cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Our ability to monitor our third-party vendors and service providers' data security is limited. Threat actors may be able to circumvent those security measures and gain unauthorized access to, or cause misuse, disclosure, loss, destruction or other unauthorized processing of, our and our customers' data, including sensitive and personal information. Further, threat actors may attempt to deploy malicious code to users of the open source libraries leveraged by our products, which could negatively affect us and those users.

Techniques used to sabotage or obtain unauthorized access to systems or networks are constantly evolving and, in some instances, are not identified until launched against a target. We and our third-party vendors and service providers may be unable to anticipate these techniques, react to them in a timely manner, or implement adequate preventative measures. Because of the complexity and interconnectedness of our systems and networks and those on which we rely, the process of upgrading or patching our protective measures could itself create a risk of cybersecurity issues or system disruptions, including for customers who rely upon, or have exposure to, such systems and networks.

Limitations of liability provisions in our customer and user agreements, contracts with third-party vendors and service providers or other contracts may not be enforceable or adequate to protect us from any liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim relating to a security incident. We are subject to risks that our existing insurance coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms or available in sufficient amounts to cover claims related to a cybersecurity incident, or that the insurer may deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could adversely affect our business.

## Our ability to grow our business may suffer if we are unable to expand adoption of our Elastic Cloud offerings.

We believe our future success will depend significantly on the growth in the adoption of Elastic Cloud, our family of cloud-based offerings. We have incurred and will continue to incur substantial costs to develop, sell and support our

Elastic Cloud offerings. We have also entered into non-cancelable multi-year cloud hosting capacity commitments with certain third-party cloud providers, which require us to pay for such capacity irrespective of actual usage. We believe that we must offer a family of cloud-based products to address the market segment that prefers a cloudbased solution to a self-managed solution and that there will be increasing demand for cloud-based offerings of our products. For the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, Elastic Cloud contributed 43% and 40% of our total revenue, respectively. However, as the use of cloud-based computing solutions is rapidly evolving, it is difficult to predict the potential growth, if any, of general market adoption, customer adoption, and retention rates of our cloudbased offerings. There could be decreased demand for our cloud-based offerings due to reasons within or outside of our control, including, among other factors, lack of customer acceptance, technological challenges with bringing cloud offerings to market and maintaining those offerings, information security, data protection, or privacy concerns, our inability to properly manage and support our cloud-based offerings, competing technologies and products, weakening economic conditions, and decreases in corporate spending. If we are not able to develop, market, or deliver cloud-based offerings that satisfy customer requirements technically or commercially, if our investments in cloud-based offerings do not yield the expected return, or if we are unable to decrease the cost of providing our cloud-based offerings, our business, competitive position, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed.

## Our operating results are likely to fluctuate from quarter to quarter, and our financial results in any one quarter should not be relied upon as indicative of future performance.

Our results of operations, including our revenue, cost of revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, cash flow and deferred revenue, have fluctuated from quarter-to-quarter in the past and may continue to vary significantly in the future so that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful. These variations may be further impacted as more of our Elastic Cloud customers adopt consumption-based arrangements or as Elastic Cloud customers already on consumption-based arrangements optimize their usage in response to the current macroeconomic environment. Accordingly, our financial results in any one quarter should not be relied upon as indicative of future performance. Our quarterly financial results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, may be difficult to predict, and may or may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business. Factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly financial results include the risks and uncertainties described in this 'Risk Management and Risk Factors' section and elsewhere in this Report. The impact of one or more of these factors may cause our operating results to vary significantly. Such fluctuations in our results could cause us to fail to meet the expectations of investors or securities analysts, which could cause the trading price of our ordinary shares to fall substantially, and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits, which could have an adverse effect on our business.

## Seasonality may cause fluctuations in our sales and results of operations.

Historically, we have experienced quarterly fluctuations and seasonality in our sales and results of operations based on the timing of our entry into agreements with new and existing customers, customer usage patterns for our consumption-based arrangements, and the mix between annual and monthly contracts entered into each reporting period. Trends in our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows are impacted by seasonality in our sales cycle, which generally reflects a trend toward the highest sales in our fourth fiscal quarter and the lowest sales in our first fiscal quarter. We expect that this seasonality will continue to affect our results of operations in the future, and might become more pronounced as we continue to target larger enterprise customers.

## If our existing customers do not renew their subscriptions, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.

We derive a significant portion of our revenue from renewals of existing subscriptions. Our customers have no contractual obligation to renew their subscriptions after the completion of their subscription term. Our subscriptions for self-managed deployments typically range from one to three years, while many of our Elastic Cloud customers purchase subscriptions either on a month-to-month basis or on a committed contract of generally one to three years in duration.

Our customers may decline to renew their contracts as a result of a number of factors, including their budgets, their satisfaction with our products and our customer support, our products' ability to integrate with new and changing technologies, the frequency and severity of product outages, our product uptime or latency, and the pricing of our products or competing products. If our customers renew their subscriptions, they may renew for shorter subscription terms or on other terms that are less economically beneficial to us. If our existing customers do not renew their subscriptions, or renew on less favorable terms, our revenue may grow more slowly than expected or decline.

If we are unable to increase sales of our subscriptions to new customers, sell additional subscriptions to our existing customers, or expand the value of our existing customers' subscriptions, our revenue growth rate may decline.

We offer certain features of our products with no payment required. Customers purchase subscriptions in order to gain access to additional functionality and support. Our future success depends on our ability to sell our

subscriptions to new customers, including to large enterprises, and to expand the deployment of our offerings with existing customers by selling paid subscriptions to our existing users and expanding the value and number of existing customers' subscriptions. Our ability to sell new subscriptions depends on a number of factors, including the prices of our offerings, the prices of products offered by our competitors, and the budgets of our customers. We also face difficulty in displacing the products of incumbent competitors. In addition, a significant aspect of our sales and marketing focus is to expand deployments within existing customers. The rate at which our existing customers purchase additional subscriptions and expand the value of existing subscriptions depends on a number of factors, including customers' level of satisfaction with our offerings, the nature and size of the deployments, the desire to address additional use cases, the perceived need for additional features, and general economic conditions. If our existing customers do not purchase additional subscriptions or expand the value of their subscriptions, our Net Expansion Rate may decline. We rely in large part on our customers to identify new use cases for our products in order to expand such deployments and grow our business. If our customers do not recognize the potential of our offerings, our business would be materially and adversely affected. If our efforts to sell subscriptions to new customers and to expand deployments at existing customers are not successful, our total revenue and revenue growth rate may decline, and our business could suffer.

We do not have an adequate history with our consumption-based arrangements for our Elastic Cloud offerings to predict accurately the long-term rate of customer adoption or renewal, or the impact those arrangements will have on our near-term or long-term revenue or operating results.

Because we recognize revenue under a consumption-based arrangement based on actual customer consumption, we do not have the same ability to predict the timing of revenue recognition as we do under subscription arrangements where revenue is recognized on a predetermined schedule over the subscription term. Moreover, customers may consume our products at a different pace than we expect. For example, we have experienced and, if adverse economic conditions persist, may continue to experience slowing consumption as customers look to optimize their usage. Additionally, we have seen and may continue to see newer customers increase their consumption of our solutions at a slower pace than our more tenured customers. For these reasons, our revenue may be less predictable or more variable than our historical revenue, and our actual results may differ materially from our forecasts.

If we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand, especially among developers and executives with budgetary control, our ability to expand our customer base will be impaired and our business and operating results may be adversely affected.

We believe that developing and maintaining widespread awareness of our brand, especially with developers and executives with budgetary control, is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our software and attracting new users and customers. We also believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition in our market increases. Successfully maintaining and enhancing our brand will depend largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts, our ability to maintain our customers' trust, our ability to continue to develop new functionality and use cases, and our ability to successfully differentiate our products and platform capability from competitive products. Brand promotion activities may not generate user or customer awareness or increase revenue. Even if they do, any increase in revenue may not offset the expenses we incur in building our brand. For instance, our continued focus and investment in our ElasticON user conferences and similar investments in our brand, user engagement, and customer engagement may not generate the desired customer awareness or a sufficient financial return. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand, we may fail to attract or retain users and customers necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand-building efforts, or to achieve the widespread brand awareness that is critical for broad customer adoption of our products, which would adversely affect our business and results of operations.

## We may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors.

The market for our products is highly competitive, quickly evolving, fragmented, and subject to rapid changes in technology, shifting customer needs, and frequent introductions of new offerings. We believe that our ability to compete depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control.

Some of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources, stronger brand recognition, broader global distribution and presence, more established relationships with current or potential customers and partners, and larger customer bases than we do. These factors may allow our competitors to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer preferences. These competitors may engage in more extensive research and development efforts, undertake more far-reaching and successful sales and marketing campaigns, have more experienced sales professionals, execute more successfully on their go-to-market strategy and have greater access to more markets and decision makers, and adopt more aggressive pricing policies which may allow them to build larger customer bases than we have. New start-up companies that innovate and large competitors that are making significant investments in research and development may develop similar offerings that compete with our offerings or that achieve greater market acceptance than our offerings. This could attract customers away from our offerings and reduce our market share. As market segments become increasingly crowded and competition intensifies, we could potentially face increasing costs of goods and services sold. If we are unable to anticipate or react effectively

to these competitive challenges, our competitive position would weaken, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.

## If we are not able to keep pace with technological and competitive developments, our performance may be negatively affected.

The market for search technologies, including search, observability and security, is subject to rapid technological change, innovation (such as the use of AI), evolving industry standards, and changing regulations, as well as changing customer needs, requirements and preferences. Our success depends upon our ability to continue to innovate, enhance existing products, expand the use cases of our products, anticipate and respond to changing customer needs, requirements, and preferences, and develop and introduce in a timely manner new offerings that keep pace with technological and competitive developments.

We have experienced delays in releasing new products, deployment options, and product enhancements and may experience similar delays in the future. As a result, in the past, some of our customers deferred purchasing our products until the next upgrade was released. Future delays or problems in the installation or implementation of our new releases may cause customers to forgo purchases of our products and purchase products of our competitors instead.

The success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful product development, market acceptance, our ability to manage the risks associated with new product releases, the availability of software components for new products, the effective management of development and other spending in connection with anticipated demand for new products, the availability of newly developed products, and the risk that new products may have bugs, errors, or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction. We have experienced bugs, errors, or other defects or deficiencies in new products and product updates and may have similar experiences in the future. Furthermore, our ability to increase the usage of our products depends, in part, on the development of new use cases for our products, which is typically driven by our developer community and may be outside of our control. We also have invested, and may continue to invest, in the acquisition of complementary businesses, technologies, services, products and other assets that expand the products that we can offer our customers. We may make these investments without being certain that they will result in products or enhancements that will be accepted by existing or prospective customers. If we are unable to successfully enhance our existing products to meet evolving customer requirements, increase adoption and usage of our products, develop new products, or if our efforts to increase the usage of our products are more expensive than we expect, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected.

## Sales of our products could suffer if the markets for those products do not grow or if we fail to adapt and respond effectively to evolving markets.

The markets for certain of our products, such as our Search, Observability and Security solutions, are evolving and our products are relatively new in these markets. Accordingly, it is difficult to predict continued customer adoption and renewals for these products, customers' demand for these products, the size, growth rate, expansion, and longevity of these markets, the entry of competitive products, or the success of existing competitive products. Our ability to penetrate these evolving markets depends on a number of factors, including the cost, performance, and perceived value associated with our products. If these markets do not continue to grow as expected or if we are unable to anticipate or react to changes in these markets, our competitive position could weaken, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.

The length of our sales cycle can be unpredictable, particularly with respect to sales through our channel partners or sales to large customers, and our sales efforts may require considerable time and expense, which could negatively affect our cash flows and results of operations.

Our results of operations may fluctuate, in part, because of the length and variability of the sales cycle of our subscriptions and the difficulty in making short-term adjustments to our operating expenses. Our results of operations depend in part on sales to new customers, including large customers, and increasing sales to existing customers. The length of our sales cycle, from initial contact with our sales team to contractually committing to our subscriptions, can vary substantially from customer to customer based on deal complexity as well as whether a sale is made directly by us or through a channel partner. Our sales cycle can extend to more than a year for some customers, and the length of sales cycles may be further impacted due to worsening economic conditions. In addition, some customers have been scrutinizing their spending more carefully and reducing their consumption spending given the current uncertain economic environment, and we generally expect this caution to continue. We have also experienced and, if adverse economic conditions persist, may continue to experience longer and more unpredictable sales cycles. As we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, we may face greater costs, longer sales cycles, greater competition and less predictability in completing some of our sales. A customer's decision to use our solutions may be an enterprise-wide decision, which may require greater levels of education regarding the use cases of our products or protracted negotiations. In addition, larger customers may demand more configuration, integration services and features. It is difficult to predict exactly when, or even if, we will make a sale to a potential customer or if we can increase sales to our existing customers. As a result, large individual sales in some cases have occurred in quarters subsequent to those we expected, or have not occurred at

all. Lengthened or unpredictable sales cycles that cause a loss or delay of one or more large transactions in a quarter could affect our cash flows and results of operations for that quarter and for future quarters. These impacts are amplified in the short term when customers slow their consumption in response to the uncertain macroeconomic environment. Because a substantial proportion of our expenses are relatively fixed in the short term, our cash flows and results of operations could suffer if revenue falls below our expectations in a particular quarter.

Because we recognize the vast majority of the revenue from subscriptions, either based on actual consumption or ratably over the term of the relevant subscription period, downturns or upturns in sales are not immediately reflected in full in our results of operations.

Subscription revenue accounts for the substantial majority of our revenue, constituting 93% and 92% of total revenue for the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effect of significant downturns in new or renewed sales of our subscriptions is not reflected in full in our results of operations until future periods. We recognize the vast majority of our subscription revenue either based on actual consumption or ratably over the term of the relevant time period. As a result, much of the subscription revenue we report each fiscal quarter represents the recognition of deferred revenue from subscription contracts entered into during previous fiscal quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one fiscal quarter will not be fully or immediately reflected in revenue in that fiscal quarter and will negatively affect our revenue in future fiscal quarters.

## The sales prices of our offerings may decrease, which may reduce our revenue and gross profits and adversely affect our financial results.

The sales prices for our offerings may decline or we may introduce new pricing models for a variety of reasons, including competitive pricing pressures, discounts, in anticipation of or in conjunction with the introduction of new offerings, or promotional programs. Competition continues to increase in the market segments in which we operate, and we expect competition to continue to increase, thereby leading to increased pricing pressures. Larger competitors with more diverse offerings may reduce the price of offerings that compete with ours or may bundle them with other offerings. Additionally, currency fluctuations in some countries and regions and pressures from uncertain inflation and interest rate environments may negatively impact actual prices that customers and channel partners are willing to pay in those countries and regions. Any decrease in the sales prices for our offerings may reduce our revenue and gross profit, unless accompanied by an increase in volume to offset the effects of such price decreases, or in the case of gross profit, unless accompanied by a corresponding decrease of sufficient magnitude in costs. Gross profit could also be adversely impacted by a shift in the mix of our subscriptions from self-managed to our cloud offering, for which we incur hosting costs, as well as any increase in our mix of services relative to subscriptions. We may not be able to maintain our prices and gross profits at levels that will allow us to achieve and maintain profitability.

## We expect our revenue mix to vary over time, which could harm our gross margin and operating results.

We expect our revenue mix to vary over time as a result of a number of factors, any one of which or the cumulative effect of which may result in significant fluctuations in our gross margin and operating results. We expect that revenue from Elastic Cloud, which contributed 43% and 40%, of our total revenue in fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively, will continue to become a larger part of our revenue mix. Due to the differing revenue recognition policies applicable to our subscriptions and services, shifts in our business mix from quarter to quarter could produce substantial variation in revenue recognized. The variation in our revenue also may result from the growth of consumption-based arrangements for our Elastic Cloud offerings, where the revenue we recognize is tied to our customers' actual usage of our products, and further reduction in usage by customers already using a consumptionbased arrangement due to the uncertain macroeconomic environment. Further, our gross margins and operating results could be harmed by changes in revenue mix and costs, together with numerous other factors, including our entry into new markets or growth in lower margin markets; our entry into markets with different pricing and cost structures; pricing discounts; and increased price competition.

## We depend on our senior management and other key employees, and the loss of one or more of these employees or an inability to attract and retain highly skilled employees could harm our business.

Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel. The loss of the services of any of our key personnel, the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel, or delays in hiring required personnel, particularly in engineering and sales, may seriously harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, our ability to attract additional qualified personnel may be impacted by the economic uncertainty and insecurity caused by macroeconomic factors and geopolitical events. The loss of services of any of our key personnel also increases our dependency on other key personnel who remain with us. Although we have entered into employment offer letters with our key personnel, their employment is for no specific duration and constitutes at-will employment. We are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing engineering personnel because of the complexity of our products.

Our future performance also depends on the continued service and continuing contributions of our senior management, particularly our Chief Executive Officer, Ashutosh Kulkarni, and Chief Technology Officer, co-founder

and former Chief Executive Officer, Shay Banon, to execute on our business plan and to identify and pursue new opportunities and product innovations. We do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees. The loss of services of senior management could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our development and strategic objectives, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Any search for senior management in the future or any search to replace the loss of any senior management may be protracted, and we may not be able to attract a qualified candidate or replacement, as applicable, in a timely manner or at all, particularly as potential candidates may be less willing to change jobs during the unstable economic conditions caused by macroeconomic and geopolitical events.

The industry in which we operate is generally characterized by significant competition for skilled personnel as well as high employee attrition. The increased availability of hybrid or remote working arrangements within our industry has further expanded the pool of companies that can compete for our employees and employment candidates. We may not be successful in attracting, integrating, or retaining qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs. We may need to invest significant amounts of cash and equity to attract and retain new employees, and we may never realize returns on these investments. Also, to the extent we hire personnel from competitors, we may be subject to allegations that they have been improperly solicited, that they have divulged proprietary or other confidential information, or that their former employers own their inventions or other work product.

If we do not effectively develop and expand our sales and marketing capabilities, including expanding, training, and compensating our sales force, we may be unable to add new customers, increase sales to existing customers or expand the value of our existing customers' subscriptions.

We dedicate significant resources to sales and marketing initiatives, which require us to invest significant financial and other resources, including in markets in which we have limited or no experience. Our business and results of operations will be harmed if our sales and marketing efforts do not generate significant revenue increases or increases that are smaller than anticipated.

We may not achieve revenue growth from expanding our sales force if we are unable to hire, train, and retain talented and effective sales personnel. We depend on our sales force to obtain new customers and to drive additional sales to existing customers. We believe that there is significant competition for sales personnel, including sales representatives, sales managers, and sales engineers, with the requisite skills and technical knowledge. Our ability to achieve significant revenue growth will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training and retaining sufficient sales personnel to support our growth, and as we introduce new products, solutions, and marketing strategies, we may need to re-train existing sales personnel. New hires also require extensive training, which may take significant time before they achieve full productivity. Our recent hires and planned hires may not become productive as quickly as we expect, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the markets where we do business or plan to do business. As we continue to grow rapidly, a large percentage of our sales force will have relatively little experience working with us, our subscriptions, and our business model. Additionally, we may need to evolve our sales compensation plans to drive the growth of our Elastic Cloud offerings with consumption-based arrangements. Such changes may have adverse consequences if they are not designed effectively. If we are unable to hire and train sufficient numbers of effective sales personnel, our new and existing sales personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time, our sales personnel are not successful in obtaining new customers or increasing sales to our existing customer base, or our sales and marketing programs, including our sales compensation plans, are not effective, our growth and results of operations could be negatively impacted.

## Our failure to offer high-quality customer support could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

After our products are deployed within our customers' IT environments, our customers depend on our technical support services to resolve issues relating to our products. If we do not succeed in helping our customers quickly resolve post-deployment issues or provide effective ongoing support and education on our products, our ability to renew or sell additional subscriptions to existing customers or expand the value of existing customers' subscriptions would be adversely affected and our reputation with potential customers could be damaged. Many larger enterprise and government entity customers have more complex IT environments and require higher levels of support than smaller customers. If we fail to meet the requirements of these enterprise customers, it may be more difficult to increase sales with them.

Additionally, it can take several months to recruit, hire, and train qualified technical support employees. We may not be able to hire such employees fast enough to keep up with demand, particularly if the sales of our offerings exceed our internal forecasts. Due to the uncertainty related to macroeconomic conditions, there may also be more competition for qualified employees and delays in hiring, onboarding, and training new employees. To the extent that we are unsuccessful in hiring, training, and retaining adequate support resources, our ability to provide adequate and timely support to our customers, and our customers' satisfaction with our offerings, will be adversely affected. Our failure to provide and maintain, or a market perception that we do not provide or maintain, high-quality support services would have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

Our corporate culture has contributed to our success, and if we cannot maintain this culture as we grow, we could lose the innovation, creativity and entrepreneurial spirit we have worked to foster, which could harm our business.

We believe that our culture has been and will continue to be a key contributor to our success. We expect to continue to hire as we expand. If we do not continue to maintain our corporate culture as we grow, we may be unable to foster the innovation, creativity, and entrepreneurial spirit we believe we need to support our growth. Moreover, many of our existing employees may be able to receive significant proceeds from sales of our ordinary shares in the public markets, which could lead to employee attrition and disparities of wealth among our employees that might adversely affect relations among employees and our culture in general. Additional headcount growth and employee turnover may result in a change to our corporate culture, which could harm our business.

## We may not be able to realize the benefits of our marketing strategies to offer some of our product features free of charge and to provide free trials of some of our paid features.

We are dependent upon lead generation strategies, including offering free use of some of our product features and free trials of some of our paid features. These strategies may not be successful in continuing to generate sufficient sales opportunities necessary to increase our revenue. Many users never convert from the free use model or from free trials to the paid versions of our products. To the extent that users do not become, or we are unable to successfully attract, paying customers, we will not realize the intended benefits of these marketing strategies and our ability to grow our revenue will be adversely affected.

## Our international operations and expansion expose us to a variety of risks.

As of April 30, 2024, we had customers located in over 125 countries, and our strategy is to continue to expand internationally. In addition, as of April 30, 2024, as a result of our strategy of leveraging a distributed workforce, we had employees located in over 35 countries. Our current international operations involve and future initiatives may involve a variety of risks, including:

- political and economic instability related to international disputes, such as the evolving conflict in Israel and Gaza and Russia's war with Ukraine and the related impact on macroeconomic conditions as a result of such conflicts, which may negatively impact our customers, partners, and vendors;
- unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, taxes, trade laws, tariffs, export quotas, custom duties or other trade restrictions;
- different labor regulations, especially in the European Union, where labor laws are generally more advantageous to employees than in the United States, including deemed hourly wage and overtime regulations in these locations;
- exposure to many stringent regulations relating to privacy, data protection and information security, particularly in the European Union, and potentially inconsistent laws and regulations in these areas across countries;
- changes in a specific country's or region's political or economic conditions;
- the evolving relations between the United States and China;
- changes in relations between the Netherlands and the United States;
- risks resulting from changes in currency exchange rates and inflationary pressures;
- risks resulting from the migration of invoicing from local billing entities to centralized regional billing entities;
- the impact of public health epidemics or pandemics on our employees, partners, and customers;
- challenges inherent in efficiently managing an increased number of employees over large geographic distances, including the need to implement appropriate systems, policies, benefits and compliance programs;
- risks relating to enforcement of U.S. export control laws and regulations including the Export Administration Regulations ('EAR'), trade and economic sanctions, including restrictions promulgated by the Office of Foreign Assets Control ('OFAC'), and other similar trade protection regulations and measures in the United States or in other jurisdictions;
- risks relating to our third-party vendors and service providers' storage and processing of some of our and our customers' data, including any supply chain cybersecurity attacks;
- reduced ability to timely collect amounts owed to us by our customers in countries where our recourse may be more limited;
- limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations derived from one country to fund the capital needs of our operations in other countries;
- political, economic and trade uncertainties or instability related to the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union (Brexit);
- limited or unfavorable intellectual property protection; and
- exposure to liabilities under anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended ('FCPA'), and similar applicable laws and regulations in other jurisdictions.

If we are unable to address these difficulties and challenges or other problems encountered in connection with our international operations and expansion, we might incur unanticipated liabilities or we might otherwise suffer harm to our business generally.

## If we are not successful in sustaining and expanding our international business, we may incur additional losses and our revenue growth could be harmed.

Our future results depend, in part, on our ability to sustain and expand our penetration of the international markets in which we currently operate and to expand into additional international markets. We depend on direct sales and our channel partner relationships to sell our offerings in international markets. Our ability to expand internationally will depend upon our ability to deliver functionality and foreign language translations that reflect the needs of the international clients that we target. Our ability to expand internationally involves various risks, including the need to invest significant resources in such expansion, and the possibility that returns on such investments will not be achieved in the near future or at all in these less familiar competitive environments. We may also choose to conduct our international business through other partnerships. If we are unable to identify partners or negotiate favorable terms, our international growth may be limited. In addition, we have incurred and may continue to incur significant expenses before we generate material revenue as we attempt to establish our presence in particular international markets.

## We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.

A portion of our subscription revenue is generated, and a portion of our operating expenses is incurred, outside the United States in foreign currencies. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar versus foreign currencies, particularly with respect to the Euro and the British Pound Sterling, may impact our operating results when translated into U.S. dollars. Exchange rates have been volatile as a result of geopolitical conflicts and uncertain macroeconomic conditions, and this volatility may continue. A strengthening of the U.S. dollar could adversely affect year-over-year growth and increase the real cost of our offerings to our non-U.S. dollar customers, leading to delays in the purchase of our offerings and the lengthening of our sales cycle. If, as has occurred in recent periods, the strength of the U.S. dollar increases, our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected. In addition, increased international sales in the future, including through our channel partners, may result in greater foreign currency-denominated sales, increasing our foreign currency risk. Moreover, operating expenses incurred outside the United States in foreign currencies are increasing and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. If we are not able to successfully hedge against the risks associated with currency fluctuations, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.

## Any need by us to raise additional capital or generate the significant capital necessary to expand our operations and invest in new offerings could limit our ability to compete and could harm our business.

We may need to raise additional funds in the future, and we may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, if at all, particularly during times of market volatility, changes in the interest rate environment, and general economic instability. If we raise additional equity financing, our shareholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the per share value of our ordinary shares could decline. Furthermore, if we engage in debt financing, the holders of debt would have priority over the holders of our ordinary shares, and we may be required to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness. We may also be required to take other actions that would otherwise be in the interests of the debt holders and force us to maintain specified liquidity or other ratios, any of which could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. If we need additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms, we may not be able, among other actions, to:

- develop or enhance our products;
- continue to expand our sales and marketing and research and development organizations;
- acquire complementary technologies, products or businesses;
- expand operations in the United States or internationally;
- hire, train, and retain employees; or
- respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated working capital requirements.

Our failure to have sufficient capital to do any of these things could limit our ability to compete and harm our business.

## Our generation of a portion of our revenue by sales to government entities subjects us to a number of risks.

We generate an increasing portion of our revenue from sales to U.S. and non-U.S. government entities. Sales to government entities are subject to a number of risks. Selling to government entities can be highly competitive, expensive, and time-consuming, often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that these efforts will generate a sale. Government certification and security requirements for products like ours may change, thereby restricting our ability to sell into the U.S. federal government sector, U.S. state or local government sector, or government sectors of countries other than the United States until we have obtained the revised certification or met the changed security requirements. If we are unable to timely meet such requirements, our ability to compete for and retain federal government contracts may be diminished, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Government entities may have statutory, contractual, or other legal rights to terminate contracts with us or our channel partners for convenience or due to a default, and any such termination may adversely affect our future results. Government demand and payment for our offerings may be affected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations, with funding reductions or delays adversely affecting public sector demand for our offerings or exercise of options under multi-year contracts. Contracts with government agencies, including classified contracts, are subject to extensive, evolving and sometimes complex regulations, as well as audits and reviews of contractors' administrative processes and other contract related compliance obligations. Breaches of government contracts, failure to comply with applicable regulations or unfavorable findings from government audits or reviews could result in contract terminations, reputational harm or other adverse consequences, including but not limited to ineligibility to sell to government agencies in the future, government refusal to continue buying our subscriptions, a reduction of revenue, or fines or civil or criminal liability, which could adversely affect our results of operations in a material way.

If we are unable to maintain successful relationships with our partners, or if our partners fail to perform or we are unable to maintain successful relationships with them, our business operations, financial results, and growth prospects could be adversely affected.

We maintain partnership relationships with a variety of partners, including cloud providers such as Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, systems integrators, channel partners, referral partners, OEM and MSP partners, and technology partners, to deliver offerings to our end customers and complement our broad community of users. In particular, we partner with various cloud providers to jointly market, sell and deliver our Elastic Cloud offerings, which in some instances also involves technical integration with such cloud providers. Our ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will depend in part on our success in maintaining successful relationships with our partners and in helping our partners enhance their ability to market and sell our subscriptions. If we are unable to maintain our relationships with these partners, our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be harmed.

Our agreements with our partners are generally non-exclusive, so that our partners may offer customers the offerings of several different companies, including offerings that compete with ours, or may themselves be or become competitors. Some of these partners may also market, sell, and support offerings that compete with ours, may devote more resources to the marketing, sales, and support of such competitive offerings, may have incentives to promote our competitors' offerings to the detriment of our own or may cease selling our offerings altogether. If our partners do not effectively market and sell our offerings, choose to use greater efforts to market and sell their own offerings or those of our competitors, fail to provide adequate technical integration with their own offerings, fail to meet the needs of our customers, fail to deliver services to our customers, or if we lose one or more of our channel partners, our ability to expand our business and sell our offerings may be harmed. Our partners may cease marketing our offerings with limited or no notice and with little or no penalty. The loss of a substantial number of our partners, our possible inability to replace them, or the failure to recruit additional partners could harm our performance.

In addition, many of our new channel partners require extensive training and may take several months or more to become effective in marketing our offerings. Our channel partner sales structure could subject us to lawsuits, potential liability, misstatement of revenue, and reputational harm, if, for example, any of our channel partners misrepresents the functionality of our offerings to customers or violates laws or our or their corporate policies, including our terms of business, which in turn could impact reported revenue, deferred revenue, and remaining performance obligations.

## Our decision to no longer offer Elasticsearch and Kibana under an open source license may harm the adoption of Elasticsearch and Kibana.

In February 2021, with the release of version 7.11 of the Elastic Stack, we changed the source code of Elasticsearch and Kibana which had historically been licensed under Apache 2.0, to be dual licensed under Elastic License 2.0 and the SSPL, at the user's election. Neither the Elastic License nor the SSPL has been approved by the Open Source Initiative or is included in the Free Software Foundation's list of free software licenses. Further, neither has been interpreted by any court. While the vast majority of downloads of Elasticsearch and Kibana from mid-2018 through early 2021 were licensed under the Elastic License, the removal of the Apache 2.0 alternative could negatively impact certain developers for whom the availability of an open source license was important. In addition, some developers and the companies for whom they work may be hesitant to download or upgrade to new versions of Elasticsearch or Kibana under the Elastic License or SSPL because of uncertainty regarding how these licenses may be interpreted and enforced. Other developers, including competitors of Elastic such as Amazon, have announced that they have 'forked' Elasticsearch and Kibana, which means they have developed their own product or service that is based on features of Elasticsearch and Kibana that we had previously made available under an open source license. For example, Amazon has launched an open source project called OpenSearch based on a forked version of the Elastic Stack, which is licensed under Apache 2.0, and rebranded their existing Elasticsearch Service as OpenSearch Service. The combination of uncertainty regarding our dual license model and the potential competition from the forked versions of our software may negatively impact adoption of Elasticsearch and Kibana, which in turn could lead to reduced brand and product awareness and to a decline in paying customers, which could harm our ability to grow our business or achieve profitability.

## We could be negatively impacted if the Elastic License or SSPL, under which some of our software is licensed, is not enforceable.

We make the source code of our products available under Apache 2.0, the Elastic License, or as dual licensed under the Elastic License and SSPL, depending on the product and version. Apache 2.0 is a permissive open source license that allows licensees to freely copy, modify and distribute Apache 2.0-licensed software if they meet certain conditions. The Elastic License is our proprietary source available license. The Elastic License permits licensees to use, copy, modify and distribute the licensed software so long as they do not offer access to the software as a cloud service, interfere with the license key or remove proprietary notices. SSPL is a source-available license that is based on the GNU Affero General Public License ('AGPL') open source license and permits licensees to copy, modify and distribute SSPL-licensed software, but expressly requires licensees that offer the SSPL-licensed software as a third-party service to open source all of the software that they use to offer such service. We rely upon the enforceability of the restrictions set forth in the Elastic License and SSPL to protect our proprietary interests. If a court were to hold that the Elastic License or SSPL or certain aspects of these licenses are unenforceable, others may be able to use our software to compete with us in the marketplace in a manner not subject to the restrictions set forth in the Elastic License or SSPL.

## If third parties offer inadequate or defective implementations of software that we have previously made available under an open source license, we could experience lost sales and lack of market acceptance of our products.

Certain cloud hosting providers and managed service providers, including AWS, offer hosted products or services based on a forked version of the Elastic Stack, which means they offer a service that includes some of the features that we had previously made available under an open source license. These offerings are not supported by us and come without any of our proprietary features, whether free or paid. We do not control how these third parties may use or offer our open source technology. These third parties could inadequately or incorrectly implement our open source technology or fail to update such technology in light of changing technological or security requirements, which could result in real or perceived defects, security vulnerabilities, errors, or performance failures with respect to their offerings. Users, customers, and potential customers could confuse these third-party products with our products, and attribute such defects, security vulnerabilities, errors, or performance failures to our products. Any damage to our reputation and brand from defective implementations of our open source software could result in lost sales and lack of market acceptance of our products and could adversely affect our business and growth prospects.

## Limited technological barriers to entry into the markets in which we compete may facilitate entry by other enterprises into our markets to compete with us.

Anyone may obtain access to source code for the features of our software that we have licensed under open source or source available licenses. Depending on the product and version of the Elastic software, this source code is available under Apache 2.0, SSPL, or the Elastic License. Each of these licenses allows anyone, subject to compliance with the conditions of the applicable license, to redistribute our software in modified or unmodified form and use it to compete in our markets. Such competition can develop without the degree of overhead and lead time required by traditional proprietary software companies, due to the rights granted to licensees of open source and source available software. It is possible for competitors to develop their own software, including software based on our products, potentially reducing the demand for our products and putting pricing pressure on our subscriptions. For example, Amazon offers some of the features that we had previously made available under an open source license as part of its AWS offering. As such, Amazon competes with us for potential customers, and while Amazon cannot provide our proprietary software, Amazon's offerings may reduce the demand for our offerings and the pricing of Amazon's offerings may limit our ability to adjust the prices of our products. Competitive pressure in our markets generally may result in price reductions, reduced operating margins and loss of market share.

## A real or perceived defect, security vulnerability, error, or performance failure in our software could cause us to lose revenue, damage our reputation, and expose us to liability.

Our products are inherently complex and, despite extensive testing and quality control, have in the past and may in the future contain defects or errors, especially when first introduced, or otherwise not perform as contemplated. These defects, security vulnerabilities, errors or performance failures could cause damage to our reputation, loss of customers or revenue, product returns, order cancelations, service terminations, or lack of market acceptance of our software. As the use of our products, including products that were recently acquired or developed, expands to more sensitive, secure, or mission-critical uses by our customers, we may be subject to increased scrutiny, potential reputational risk, or potential liability if our software should fail to perform as contemplated in such deployments. We have issued in the past, and may need to issue in the future, corrective releases of our software to fix these defects, errors or performance failures, which could require us to allocate significant research and development and customer support resources to address these problems.

Any limitation of liability provisions that may be contained in our customer and partner agreements may not be effective as a result of existing or future applicable law or unfavorable judicial decisions. The sale and support of our

products entail the risk of liability claims, which could be substantial in light of the use of our products in enterprisewide environments. Our insurance against this liability may not be adequate to cover a potential claim.

## Interruptions or performance problems associated with our technology and infrastructure, and our reliance on technologies from third parties, may adversely affect our business operations and financial results.

We rely on third-party cloud platforms to host our cloud offerings. If we experience an interruption in service for any reason, our cloud offerings would similarly be interrupted. The ongoing effects of geopolitical conflicts, adverse economic conditions, and increased energy prices could also disrupt the supply chain of hardware needed to maintain our third-party data center operations. An interruption in our services to our customers, particularly as we increasingly attract more large customers than in the past, could cause our customers' internal and consumer-facing applications to cease functioning, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, customer relationships and reputation.

In addition, our website and internal technology infrastructure may experience performance issues due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, website or third-party hosting disruptions, capacity constraints, technical failures, natural disasters or fraud or security attacks. Our use of third-party open source software may increase this risk. If our website is unavailable or our users are unable to download our products or order subscriptions or services within a reasonable amount of time or at all, our business could be harmed. We expect to continue to make significant investments to maintain and improve website performance and to enable rapid releases of new features and applications for our products. To the extent that we do not effectively upgrade our systems as needed and continually develop our technology to accommodate actual and anticipated changes in technology, our business and results of operations may be harmed.

## Incorrect implementation or use of our software, or our customers' failure to update our software, could result in customer dissatisfaction and negatively affect our reputation and growth prospects.

Our products are often operated in large scale, complex IT environments. Our customers and some partners require training and experience in the proper use of, and the benefits that can be derived from, our products to maximize their potential value. If our products are not implemented, configured, updated, or used correctly or as intended, or in a timely manner, inadequate performance, errors, loss of data, corruptions, and/or security vulnerabilities may result. For example, there have been, and may in the future continue to be, reports that some of our customers have not properly secured implementations of our products, which can result in unprotected data. Because our customers rely on our software to manage a wide range of operations, the incorrect implementation or use of our software, our customers' failure to update our software, or our failure to train customers on how to use our software productively, may result in customer dissatisfaction or negative publicity and may adversely affect our reputation and brand. Failure by us to provide adequate training and implementation services to our customers could result in lost opportunities for follow-on sales to these customers and decrease subscriptions by new customers, and adversely affect our business and growth prospects.

## If our website fails to rank prominently in unpaid search results, traffic to our website could decline and revenue could be adversely affected.

Our success depends in part on our ability to attract users through unpaid Internet search results on traditional web search engines, such as Google. The number of users we attract to our website from search engines is due in large part to how and where our website ranks in unpaid search results. These rankings can be affected by a number of factors, many of which are not in our direct control, and they may change frequently. For example, a search engine may change its ranking algorithms, methodologies or design layouts. As a result, links to our website may not be prominent enough to drive traffic to our website, and we may not know how or otherwise be in a position to influence the results. Any reduction in the number of users directed to our website could reduce our revenue or require us to increase our customer acquisition expenditures.

## Our business operations and sales performance could be disrupted if we fail to maintain satisfactory relationships with third-party service providers on which we rely for many aspects of our business.

Our success depends upon our relationships with third-party service providers, including providers of cloud hosting infrastructure, customer relationship management systems, financial reporting systems, human resource management systems, credit card processing platforms, marketing automation systems, and payroll processing systems, among others. If any of these third parties experience difficulty meeting our requirements or standards, become unavailable due to extended outages or interruptions, temporarily or permanently cease operations, face financial distress or other business disruptions such as a security incident, or increase their fees, if our relationships with any of these providers deteriorate, or if any of the agreements we have entered into with such third parties are terminated or not renewed without adequate transition arrangements, we could suffer liabilities, penalties, fines, increased costs and delays in our ability to provide customers with our products and services, our ability to manage our finances could be interrupted, receipt of payments from customers may be delayed, our processes for managing sales of our offerings could be impaired, our ability to generate and manage sales leads could be weakened, or our business operations could be disrupted. Further, our business operations may be disrupted by

negative impacts of the evolving conflict in Israel and Gaza and Russia's war with Ukraine on supply chains of our third-party service providers. Any such disruptions may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows until we replace such providers or develop replacement technology or operations. In addition, our business may suffer if we are unsuccessful in identifying high-quality service providers, negotiating cost-effective relationships with them or effectively managing these relationships.

## Failure to establish, maintain and protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights could substantially harm our business and results of operations.

Our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to establish, maintain and protect our proprietary technology, methodologies, know-how and brand. We rely on a combination of trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets, contractual restrictions, and other intellectual property laws and confidentiality procedures to establish and protect our proprietary rights. The steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may be inadequate.

We will not be able to protect our intellectual property rights if we are unable to enforce our rights or if we do not detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights. The source code of proprietary features for some versions of the Elastic Stack offered under certain licenses is publicly available, which may enable others to replicate our proprietary technology and compete more effectively with us. If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors may gain access to our proprietary technology and our business may be harmed. In addition, defending our intellectual property rights might entail significant expense and resource allocation. Any patents, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights that we have or may obtain may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. Patent applications we file may not result in issued patents. Even if we continue to seek patent protection in the future, we may be unable to obtain further patent protection for certain aspects of our technology. In addition, any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages, or may be successfully challenged by third parties. Furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability, and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain and will vary by jurisdiction.

Despite our precautions, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our products and use information that we regard as proprietary to create offerings that compete with ours. Effective patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our products are available. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names, social media names, or trademarks that are similar to, infringe upon, or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights. The laws of some countries are not as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the United States, and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate to achieve our objectives. As we expand our international activities, our exposure to unauthorized copying and use of our products and proprietary information will likely increase.

We enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and enter into confidentiality agreements with other parties. These agreements may not be effective in controlling access to and distribution of our proprietary information. Further, these agreements may not prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our products. Our ability to enforce such agreements could be adversely affected if a rule adopted by the Federal Trade Commission ('FTC') in April 2024 withstands legal challenge. If the FTC rule takes effect, it would deem unlawful existing non-compete agreements entered into with workers who are not 'senior executives,' and would ban us from entering into new non-compete agreements with any worker, including senior executives. The FTC states that whether a given prohibition constitutes a non-compete agreement is a fact-specific inquiry so that a confidentiality undertaking, if sufficiently broad, might be seen by the FTC as a prohibited non-compete agreement.

To protect our intellectual property rights, we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. Litigation has previously been, and may in the future be, necessary to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights. Even if we prevail in such disputes, we may not be able to recover all or a portion of any judgments, and litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming, and distracting to management. If unsuccessful, litigation could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Further, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims, and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Our inability to protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized copying or use, as well as any costly litigation or diversion of our management's attention and resources, could delay further sales or the implementation of our products, impair the functionality of our products, delay introductions of new products, result in our being required to substitute inferior or more costly technologies into our products or incur warranty and indemnifications costs with our customers, or injure our reputation.

## We could incur substantial costs as a result of any claim of infringement, misappropriation or violation of another party's intellectual property rights.

In recent years, there has been significant litigation involving patents and other intellectual property rights in the software industry. Companies providing software are increasingly bringing and becoming subject to suits alleging infringement, misappropriation or violation of proprietary rights, particularly patent rights, and to the extent we gain greater market visibility, we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement, misappropriation or violation claims. The risk of patent litigation has been amplified by the increase in the number of

a type of patent holder, which we refer to as a non-practicing entity, whose sole or principal business is to assert such claims and against whom our own intellectual property portfolio may provide little deterrent value. We could incur substantial costs in prosecuting or defending any intellectual property litigation. While we do not provide large language models, our products and solutions may contain integrations of third party large language models, which may indirectly expose us to copyright infringement or other intellectual property misappropriation claims depending on the datasets and training models used by such third parties in their AI and generative AI offerings. If we sue to enforce our rights or are sued by a third party that claims that our products infringe, misappropriate or violate its rights, the litigation could be expensive and could divert our management resources from operations.

Any intellectual property litigation to which we might become a party, or for which we are required to provide indemnification, may require us to do one or more of the following:

- cease selling or using products that incorporate the intellectual property rights that we allegedly infringe, misappropriate or violate;
- make substantial payments for legal fees, settlement payments or other costs or damages;
- obtain a license, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, to sell or use the relevant technology; or
- redesign the allegedly infringing products to avoid infringement, misappropriation or violation, which could be costly, time-consuming or impossible.

If we are required to make substantial payments or undertake any of the other actions noted above as a result of any intellectual property infringement, misappropriation or violation claims against us or any obligation to indemnify our customers for such claims, such payments or actions could harm our business.

## Indemnity provisions in various agreements potentially expose us to substantial liability for intellectual property infringement, misappropriation, violation and other losses.

Our agreements with customers and other third parties may include indemnification provisions under which we agree to indemnify them for losses suffered or incurred as a result of claims of intellectual property infringement, misappropriation or violation, damages caused by us to property or persons, or other liabilities relating to or arising from our software, services or other contractual obligations. Large indemnity payments could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. Although we normally contractually limit our liability with respect to such indemnity obligations, we may still incur substantial liability related to them. Any dispute with a customer with respect to such obligations could have adverse effects on our relationship with that customer and other existing customers and new customers and harm our business and results of operations.

## Our use of third-party open source software within our products could negatively affect our ability to sell our products and subject us to litigation.

Our technologies strategically incorporate open source software from other developers, and we expect to continue to incorporate such open source software in our products in the future. Few of the licenses applicable to open source software have been interpreted by courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products. Moreover, we may not have incorporated third-party open source software in our software in a manner that is consistent with the terms of the applicable license or our current policies and procedures. If we fail to comply with these licenses, we may be subject to certain requirements, including requirements that we offer our solutions that incorporate the open source software for no cost, that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon incorporating or using the open source software, and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of applicable open source licenses. Additionally, some open source software may include output from generative AI software or other software that incorporates or relies on generative AI or other AI technologies. The use of such open source software may expose us to risks as the intellectual property ownership and license rights, including copyright, of generative AI software and tools have not been fully interpreted by U.S. courts or been fully addressed by federal or state regulation or those of other international legal jurisdictions in which we do business. Attempting to ensure compliance of integrating such open source and generative AI components with licensing terms, regulatory changes, and our required intellectual property guidelines and legal requirements to do business may result in the expenditure of significant resources and in our failure to meet all relevant, material software release timetables and requirements. Moreover, changes in supply chain and export control regulations imposed by the United States and other governments due to geopolitical changes and government policies may require us to make changes to certain of our open source and other thirdparty dependencies, which may result in additional costs and may adversely impact customer use and adoption of our solutions.

If an author or other third party that distributes such open source software were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses, we could incur significant legal expenses defending against such allegations and could be subject to significant damages, enjoined from the sale of our products that contained the open source software and required to comply with onerous conditions or restrictions on these products, which could disrupt the distribution and sale of these products. In addition, there have been claims challenging the ownership rights in open source software against companies that incorporate open source software into their products, and the licensors of such open source software provide no warranties or indemnities with respect to such claims. In any of these events, we and our customers could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order

to continue offering our products, and to re-engineer our products or discontinue the sale of our products in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis. We and our customers may also be subject to suits by parties claiming infringement, misappropriation or violation due to the reliance by our solutions on certain open source software, and such litigation could be costly for us to defend or subject us to an injunction. Some open source projects have known vulnerabilities and architectural instabilities and are provided on an 'as-is' basis which, if not properly addressed, could negatively affect the performance of our product. Any of the foregoing could require us to devote additional research and development resources to re-engineer our solutions, could result in customer dissatisfaction, and may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

## Risks Related to Taxation

Unanticipated changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could expose us to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.

Our income tax obligations are based in part on our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements, including the manner in which we develop, value, and use our intellectual property and the valuations of our intercompany transactions. The tax laws applicable to our business, including the laws of the Netherlands, the United States and other jurisdictions, are subject to change and interpretation. Any new legislation or interpretations of existing legislation could impact our tax obligations in countries where we do business or cause us to change the way we operate our business and result in increased taxation of our international earnings.

For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD')/G20 Inclusive Framework has been working on addressing the tax challenges arising from the digitalization of the economy, including by releasing the OECD's Pillar One and Pillar Two blueprints on October 12, 2020. Pillar One refers to the re-allocation of taxing rights to jurisdictions where sustained and significant business is conducted, regardless of a physical presence, while Pillar Two establishes a minimum tax to be paid by multinational enterprises. On December 15, 2022, the Council of the EU formally adopted Directive (EU) 2022/2523 (the 'Pillar Two Directive') to achieve a coordinated implementation of Pillar Two in EU Member States consistent with EU law. In the Netherlands, this directive has been implemented in the Minimum Tax Rate Act 2024 (Wet minimumbelasting 2024). This measure will ensure that multinational enterprises that are within the scope of the Pillar Two rules will be subject to a corporate tax rate of at least 15%. We do not currently believe that the Minimum Tax Rate Act 2024 will have a material adverse effect on our financial results.

In 2022, the United States enacted legislation implementing several changes to U.S. tax laws, including a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax on applicable corporations with an average adjusted financial statement income (AFSI) in excess of $1 billion for any three consecutive years preceding the tax year at issue. In addition, on January 1, 2022, a provision of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 went into effect that eliminates the option to deduct domestic research and development costs in the year incurred and instead requires taxpayers to amortize such costs over five years. These provisions do not materially affect our cash flows or deferred tax assets.

The United States has enacted legislation imposing a new minimum tax called the Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax (the 'BEAT') on certain U.S. corporations. The BEAT is imposed on certain deductible amounts paid by a U.S. corporation that (i) has aggregate gross receipts of at least $1.5 billion over its three prior taxable years and (ii) is at least 25%-owned by a non-U.S. person (or otherwise related to a non-U.S. person in specified circumstances). The BEAT taxes 'modified taxable income' of a U.S. corporation described above at a rate which increased to 10% in 2019 and will increase further to 12.5% in 2026. In general, modified taxable income is calculated by adding back to the U.S. corporation's regular taxable income the amount of certain 'base erosion tax benefits' with respect to payments to foreign affiliates, as well as the 'base erosion percentage' of any net operating loss deductions. The BEAT applies only to the extent it exceeds the U.S. corporation's regular corporate income tax liability (determined without regard to certain tax credits).

The applicability of sales, use and other indirect tax laws or regulations on our business is uncertain. Adverse tax laws or regulations could be enacted or existing laws could be applied to us or our customers, which could subject us to additional tax liability and related interest and penalties, increase the costs of our services and adversely impact our business.

The application of U.S. federal, state, local, and non-U.S. tax laws to services provided electronically is evolving. New sales, use, value-added, goods and services, consumption or other direct or indirect tax laws could be enacted at any time (possibly with retroactive effect), and could be applied solely or disproportionately to services provided over the Internet, directly or through partners, or could otherwise materially affect our financial position and operating results. As we expand the scale of our international business activities, any changes in the U.S. or nonU.S. taxation of such activities may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.

In addition, tax jurisdictions have differing rules and regulations governing sales, use, value-added, goods and services, consumption and other taxes, and these rules and regulations can be complex and are subject to varying interpretations that may change over time. Existing tax laws could be interpreted, changed, modified, or applied adversely to us (possibly with retroactive effect), which could require us or our customers to pay additional tax amounts on prior sales and going forward, as well as require us or our customers to pay fines or penalties and

interest for past amounts. Although our customer contracts typically provide that our customers must pay all applicable sales and similar taxes, our customers may be reluctant to pay back taxes and associated interest or penalties, or we may determine that it would not be commercially feasible to seek reimbursement. If we are required to collect and pay back taxes and associated interest and penalties, or we are unsuccessful in collecting such amounts from our customers, we could incur potentially substantial unplanned expenses, thereby adversely impacting our operating results and cash flows. Imposition of such taxes on our services going forward could also adversely affect our sales activity and have an adverse impact on our operating results and cash flows.

## Our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements are subject to the tax laws of various jurisdictions under which we could be obligated to pay additional taxes.

Based on our current corporate structure, we may be subject to taxation in several jurisdictions around the world with increasingly complex tax laws, the application of which can be uncertain. The amount of taxes we pay in these jurisdictions could increase substantially as a result of changes in the applicable tax principles, including increased tax rates, new tax laws or revised interpretations of existing tax laws and precedents. The taxing authorities of some of such jurisdictions may challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements, which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations. Tax authorities examine and may audit our income tax returns and other non-income tax returns, such as payroll, sales, value-added, net worth or franchise, property, goods and services, and excise taxes, in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions. It is possible that tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken, and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our financial position and results of operations. Further, the determination of our worldwide provision for, or benefit from, income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management, and there are transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.

## Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.

As of April 30, 2024, we had net operating loss carryforwards ('NOL') for Netherlands, United States (federal and state, respectively) and United Kingdom income tax purposes of $1.237 billion, $806.9 million, $641.7 million and $78.2 million, respectively, which may be utilized against future income taxes. Limitations imposed by the applicable jurisdictions on our ability to utilize NOLs could cause income taxes to be paid earlier than would be paid if such limitations were not in effect and could cause such NOLs to expire unused, in each case reducing or eliminating the benefit of such NOLs. Furthermore, we may not be able to generate sufficient taxable income to utilize affected NOLs before they expire. If any of these events occur, we may not derive some or all of the expected benefits from our NOLs.

## U.S. persons who hold our ordinary shares may suffer adverse tax consequences if we are characterized as a passive foreign investment company.

A non-U.S. corporation will generally be considered a passive foreign investment company ('PFIC'), for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in any taxable year if either (i) at least 75% of its gross income for such year is passive income or (ii) at least 50% of the value of its assets (based on an average of the quarterly values of the assets during such year) is attributable to assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income ('the PFIC asset test'). For purposes of the PFIC asset test, the value of our assets will generally be determined by reference to our market capitalization. Based on our past and current projections of our income and assets, we do not expect to be a PFIC for the current taxable year or for the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, a separate factual determination as to whether we are or have become a PFIC must be made each year (after the close of such year). Since our projections may differ from our actual business results and our market capitalization and value of our assets may fluctuate, we cannot assure you that we will not be or become a PFIC in the current taxable year or any future taxable year. If we are a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. person (as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended) holds our ordinary shares, such U.S. person may be subject to adverse tax consequences. Each U.S. person who holds our ordinary shares is strongly urged to consult his, her or its tax advisor regarding the application of these rules and the availability of any potential elections.

## If a U.S. person is treated as owning at least 10% of our ordinary shares, such U.S. person may be subject to adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences.

If a U.S. person is treated as owning (directly, indirectly, or constructively) at least 10% of the total combined voting power of our shares, or of the total value of our shares, such shareholder may be treated as a 'United States shareholder' with respect to each 'controlled foreign corporation' in our group (if any). Because our group includes one or more U.S. subsidiaries, certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries could be treated as controlled foreign corporations (regardless of whether we are treated as a controlled foreign corporation). A United States shareholder of a controlled foreign corporation may be required to report annually and include in its U.S. taxable income its pro

rata share of 'Subpart F income,' 'global intangible low-taxed income,' and investments in U.S. property by controlled foreign corporations, regardless of whether we make any distributions. An individual that is a United States shareholder with respect to a controlled foreign corporation generally would not be allowed certain tax deductions or foreign tax credits that would be allowed to a United States shareholder that is a U.S. corporation. We cannot provide any assurances that we will assist investors in determining whether we or any of our non-U.S. subsidiaries is treated as a controlled foreign corporation or whether any investor is treated as a United States shareholder with respect to any such controlled foreign corporation or furnish to any investor who may be a United States shareholder information that may be necessary to comply with the reporting and tax paying obligations referred to above. Failure to comply with these reporting obligations may subject a shareholder who is a United States shareholder to significant monetary penalties and may prevent from starting the statute of limitations with respect to such shareholder's U.S. federal income tax return for the year for which reporting was due. A U.S. person should consult its advisors regarding the potential application of these rules to an investment in our ordinary shares.

## We may not be able to make distributions or repurchase shares without subjecting our shareholders to Dutch withholding tax.

We have not paid a dividend on our ordinary shares in the past and we do not intend to pay any dividends to holders of our ordinary shares in the foreseeable future. See 'Risks Related to Ownership of our Ordinary Shares We do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future, so your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our ordinary shares.' However, if we ever do pay dividends or repurchase shares, then under current Dutch tax law, the dividend paid or repurchase price paid may be subject to Dutch dividend withholding tax at a rate of 15% under the Dutch Dividend Withholding Tax Act (Wet op de dividendbelasting 1965, 'Regular Dividend Withholding Tax'), unless a domestic or treaty exemption applies.

In addition, dividends paid to related entities in designated low-tax jurisdictions may be subject to an alternative withholding tax ('Alternative Withholding Tax') at the highest Dutch corporate income tax rate in effect at the time of the distribution (currently 25.8%). An entity is considered related if (i) it has a 'Qualifying Interest' in our company, (ii) our company has a 'Qualifying Interest' in the entity holding the ordinary shares, or (iii) a third party has a "Qualifying Interest" in both our company and the entity holding the ordinary shares. The term 'Qualifying Interest' means a direct or indirectly held interest either by an entity individually or jointly if an entity is part of a collaborating group (samenwerkende groep) that enables such entity or such collaborating group to exercise a definite influence over another entity's decisions, such as our company or an entity holding ordinary shares, as the case may be, and allows it to determine the other entity's activities. The Alternative Withholding Tax will be reduced, but not below zero, with any Regular Dividend Withholding Tax imposed on distributions. Based on currently applicable rates, the overall effective rate of withholding of Regular Dividend Withholding Tax and Alternative Withholding Tax will not exceed the highest corporate income tax rate in effect at the time of the distribution (currently 25.8%).

If we cease to be a Dutch tax resident for the purposes of a tax treaty concluded by the Netherlands and in certain other events, we could potentially be subject to a proposed Dutch dividend withholding tax in respect of a deemed distribution of our entire market value less paid-up capital.

Under a proposal of law currently pending before the Dutch Parliament, the Emergency act conditional exit dividend withholding tax (Spoedwet conditionele eindafrekening dividendbelasting, 'DWT Exit Tax'), we will be deemed to have distributed an amount equal to our entire market capitalization less recognized paid-up capital immediately before the occurrence of certain events, including if we cease to be a Dutch tax resident for purposes of a tax treaty concluded by the Netherlands with another jurisdiction and become, for purposes of such tax treaty, exclusively a tax resident of that other jurisdiction which is a qualifying jurisdiction. A qualifying jurisdiction is a jurisdiction other than a member state of the EU/EEA which does not impose a withholding tax on distributions, or that does impose such tax but that grants a step-up for earnings attributable to the period before we become exclusively a resident in such jurisdiction. This deemed distribution will be subject to a 15% tax insofar as it exceeds a franchise of EUR 50 million. The tax will be payable by us as a withholding agent. A full exemption applies to entities and individuals that are resident in an EU/EEA member state or a state that has concluded a tax treaty with the Netherlands that contains a dividend article, provided we submit a declaration confirming the satisfaction of applicable conditions by qualifying shareholders within one month following the taxable event. We will be deemed to have withheld the tax on the deemed distribution and have a statutory right to recover this from our shareholders. Dutch resident shareholders qualifying for the exemption are entitled to a credit or refund, and non-Dutch resident shareholders qualifying for the exemption are entitled to a refund, subject to applicable statutory limitations, provided the tax has been actually recovered from them.

The DWT Exit Tax proposal has been amended several times since the initial proposal and is under ongoing discussion. In addition, a critical reaction from authorities to the latest proposal of law have been published. It is therefore not certain whether the DWT Exit Tax will be enacted and if so, in what form. If enacted in its present form, the DWT Exit Tax will have retroactive effect as from December 8, 2021.

## Risks Related to Regulatory Matters

Any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with government or other obligations related to privacy, data protection and information security could adversely affect our business.

We are subject to compliance risks and uncertainties under a variety of federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing privacy, data protection, information security, and the collection, storage, transfer, use, retention, sharing, disclosure, protection, and processing of personal data. Privacy, data protection, and information security laws may be interpreted and applied differently depending on the jurisdiction and continue to evolve, making it difficult to predict how they may develop and apply to us.

The regulatory frameworks for these issues worldwide are rapidly evolving and are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. Federal, state, or non-U.S. government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted, and may in the future adopt, new laws and regulations or may make amendments to existing laws and regulations affecting data protection, data privacy and/or information security and/or regulating the use of the Internet as a commercial medium.

In the United States, many states have enacted such legislation. These laws and regulations may include a private right of action for certain data breaches or noncompliance with privacy or security obligations, may provide for penalties and other remedies, and may require us to incur substantial costs and expenses and liabilities in connection with our compliance. Other U.S. states and the U.S. federal government are considering or have enacted similar privacy legislation or regulations. Many obligations under these laws and legislative or regulatory proposals remain uncertain, and we cannot fully predict their impact on our business. Failure to comply with these varying laws and standards may subject us to investigations, enforcement actions, civil litigation, fines and other penalties, all of which may generate negative publicity and have a negative impact on our business.

Internationally, most jurisdictions in which we operate have established their own privacy, data protection and information security legal frameworks with which we or our customers must comply. Within the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation ('GDPR') applies to the processing of personal data. The GDPR imposes significant obligations upon our business, and compliance with these obligations can vary depending on how different regulators may interpret them. Failure to comply, or perceived failure to comply, can result in administrative fines of up to 20 million Euros or four percent of the group's annual global turnover, whichever is higher. Similarly, the United Kingdom has implemented legislation that is substantially similar to the GDPR where penalties for violations, actual or perceived, can be up to 17.5 million British Pound Sterling or four percent of the group's annual global turnover, whichever is higher, which may be subject to change with the introduction of the Data Protection and Digital Information ('DPDI') Bill in 2023. The potential impact to our business remains unclear.

On May 22, 2023, Ireland's Data Protection Commission ('DPC') found that a company's use of standard contractual clauses ('SCC') in its data transfers failed to adequately protect the personal data of its European users, and fined that company approximately $1.3 billion. While the full implications of this DPC decision for other companies such as us are not yet clear, those implications may, among other matters, affect our ability to continue using SCCs in our contracts or subject us to increased risk of regulatory fines related to our use of SCCs. Furthermore, in July 2023, the European Commission adopted its adequacy decision on data transfers under the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework ('DPF'). The adequacy decision provides a new lawful basis for trans-Atlantic data transfers from data exporters in the EU to U.S. data importers who certify compliance with the DPF principles. The DPF is currently being challenged, including by a member of the French Parliament. In light of these and other ongoing developments relating to cross-border data transfer, we may experience additional costs associated with increased compliance burdens, and this regulation may impact our ability to transfer personal data across our organization, to customers, or to third parties.

In addition to government regulation, industry groups have established or may establish new and different selfregulatory standards that may legally or contractually apply to us or our customers. One example of such a selfregulatory standard is the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, known as PCI DSS, which relates to the processing of payment card information. Moreover, our customers increasingly expect us to comply with more stringent privacy, data protection, and information security requirements than those imposed by laws, regulations, or self-regulatory requirements, and we may be obligated contractually to comply with additional or different standards relating to our handling or protection of data on or by our offerings. Any failure to meet our customers' requirements may adversely affect our revenues and prospects for growth.

We also expect that there will continue to be changes in interpretations of existing or new laws and regulations, proposed laws, and other obligations, which could impair our or our customers' ability to process personal data, decrease demand for our offerings, impact our marketing efforts, increase our costs, and impair our ability to maintain and grow our customer base and increase our revenue. It is possible that these laws and regulations or other actual or asserted obligations relating to privacy, data protection, or information security may be interpreted and applied in manners that are, or are alleged to be, inconsistent with our data management practices or the features of our products. In such an event, we could face fines, lawsuits, regulatory investigations, and other claims and penalties, and we could be required to fundamentally change our products or our business practices, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business.

Data protection authorities and other regulatory bodies are increasingly focused on the use of online tracking tools and have issued or plan to issue rulings which may impact our marketing practices. Any restrictions on using online analytics and tracking tools could lead to substantial costs, require significant changes to our policies and practices, limit the effectiveness of our marketing activities, divert the attention of our technology personnel, adversely affect our margins, and subject us to additional liabilities.

We publicly post privacy statements and other documentation regarding our practices concerning the processing, use and disclosure of personal data. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with such statements could result in potential actions by regulatory bodies or government entities if they are found to be unfair or

misrepresentative of our actual practices or inconsistent with legal requirements for such statements resulting in increased costs, changes in our business practices, or reputational harm.

We are subject to governmental export and import controls and economic sanctions programs that could impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to liability if we violate these controls.

Our software and services, in some cases, are subject to U.S. export control laws and regulations including the EAR, and trade and economic sanctions maintained by OFAC as well as similar laws and regulations in the countries in which we do business. An export license may be required to export or re-export our software and services to, or import our software and services into, certain countries and to certain end-users or for certain enduses. If we were to fail to comply with such U.S. and foreign export control laws and regulations, trade and economic sanctions, or other similar laws, we could be subject to both civil and criminal penalties, including substantial fines, possible incarceration for employees and managers for willful violations, and the possible loss of our export or import privileges. Obtaining the necessary export license for a particular sale or offering may not be possible and may be time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. Furthermore, export control laws and economic sanctions in many cases prohibit the export of software and services to certain embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments and persons, as well as for prohibited end-uses. Monitoring and ensuring compliance with these complex U.S. export control laws involves uncertainties because our offerings are widely distributed throughout the world, and information available on the users of these offerings is, in some cases, limited. Even though we take precautions in an effort to ensure that we and our partners comply with all relevant export control laws and regulations, any failure by us or our partners to comply with such laws and regulations could have negative consequences for us, including reputational harm, government investigations and penalties.

Various countries have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products and services or could limit our end customers' ability to implement our products in those countries based on encryption in our offerings. Changes in our products or changes in export and import regulations in such countries may create delays in the introduction of our products and services into international markets, prevent our end customers with international operations from deploying our products globally or, in some cases, prevent or delay the export or import of our products and services to certain countries, governments or persons altogether. Reduced use of our products and services by, or decreased ability by us to export or sell our products to, existing or potential end customers with international operations could result from changes in export or import laws or regulations, economic sanctions or related legislation; shifts in the enforcement or scope of existing export, import or sanctions laws or regulations; or changes in the countries, governments, persons, or technologies targeted by such export, import or sanctions laws or regulations.

## Failure to comply with anti-bribery, anti-corruption, and anti-money laundering laws could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.

We are required to comply with the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-bribery, anti-corruption, and antimoney laundering laws in various U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions. We are subject to compliance risks as a result of our use of channel partners to sell our offerings abroad and our use of other third parties, including recruiting firms, professional employer organizations, legal, accounting and other professional advisors, and local vendors to meet our needs in international markets. We and these third parties may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies, or state-owned or affiliated entities, and we may be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of our channel partners and third-party representatives, as well as our employees, representatives, contractors, partners, and agents, even if we do not authorize such activities. While we have policies and procedures to address compliance with such laws, our channel partners, third-party representatives, employees, contractors or agents may take actions in violation of our policies and applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. Any violation of the FCPA, U.K. Bribery Act or other applicable anti-bribery, anticorruption laws, and anti-money laundering laws could result in whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil sanctions, or suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracts, all of which may have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, operating results and prospects.

## Risks Related to Ownership of our Ordinary Shares

## The market price for our ordinary shares has been and is likely to continue to be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance.

The stock markets, and securities of technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. Stock prices of many technology companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In particular, stock prices of companies with significant operating losses have recently declined significantly, and in many instances more significantly than stock prices of companies with operating profits. The economic impact and uncertainty of changes in the inflation, interest and macroeconomic environments, and geopolitical conflicts exacerbated this volatility in both the overall stock markets and the market price of our ordinary shares. A significant decline in the price of our shares could have an adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention. In the past, shareholders have instituted securities

class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, our involvement could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our operations and adversely affect our business. The market price of our ordinary shares may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including those resulting from the risks and uncertainties described in this 'Risk Management and Risk Factors' section.

## We may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business and future operating results, which would cause our stock price to decline.

We have provided and may continue to provide guidance and other expectations regarding our future performance in our quarterly and annual earnings conference calls, quarterly and annual earnings releases, or other public disclosures. Guidance, as well as other expectations, are forward-looking and represent our management's estimates as of the date of release and are based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, while presented with numerical specificity, are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies on our business, many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions, some of which will change. Furthermore, analysts and investors may develop and publish their own forecasts concerning our financial results, which may form a consensus about our future performance. Our actual business results may vary significantly from such guidance or other expectations or that consensus due to a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including due to the global economic uncertainty and financial market conditions caused by the current macroeconomic environment, and which could adversely affect our business and future operating results. Furthermore, if we make downward revisions of our previously announced guidance or other expectations, if we withdraw our previously announced guidance or other expectations, or if our publicly announced guidance or other expectations of future operating results fail to meet expectations of securities analysts, investors or other interested parties, the price of our ordinary shares could decline. In light of the foregoing, investors should not unduly rely upon our guidance or other expectations in making an investment decision regarding our ordinary shares.

The concentration of our share ownership with insiders will likely limit your ability to influence corporate matters, including the ability to influence the outcome of director elections and other matters requiring shareholder approval.

Our executive officers and directors together beneficially own a significant amount of our outstanding ordinary shares. As a result, these shareholders, acting together, will have significant influence over matters that require approval by our shareholders, including matters such as adoption of the financial statements, declarations of dividends, the appointment and dismissal of directors, capital increases, amendment to our articles of association and approval of significant corporate transactions. Corporate action might be taken even if other shareholders oppose them. This concentration of ownership might also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us that other shareholders may view as beneficial.

## The issuance of additional ordinary shares in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, our equity incentive plans or otherwise will dilute all other shareholders.

Our articles of association authorize us to issue up to 165 million ordinary shares and up to 165 million preference shares with such rights and preferences as are included in our articles of association. On October 5, 2023, our general meeting of shareholders (the '2023 General Meeting') empowered our board of directors to issue ordinary shares up to 20% of our issued share capital as of August 21, 2023, for a period of 18 months from October 5, 2023 (the '2023 share issuance authorization'). In line with market practice for Dutch publicly traded companies, we expect to renew this authorization annually at our general meeting of shareholders. Subject to compliance with applicable rules and regulations and the above authorization limitation, we may issue ordinary shares or securities convertible into ordinary shares from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, investment, our equity incentive plans or otherwise. Any such issuance could result in substantial dilution to our existing shareholders unless pre-emptive rights exist and cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline.

## Certain holders of our ordinary shares may not be able to exercise pre-emptive rights and as a result may experience substantial dilution upon future issuances of ordinary shares.

Holders of our ordinary shares in principle have a pro rata pre-emptive right with respect to any issue of ordinary shares or the granting of rights to subscribe for ordinary shares, unless Dutch law or our articles of association state otherwise or unless explicitly provided otherwise in a resolution by our general meeting of shareholders ('general meeting'), or if authorized by the annual general meeting or an extraordinary general meeting, by a resolution of our board of directors. Our 2023 general meeting has empowered our board of directors to limit or exclude pre-emptive rights on ordinary shares issued pursuant to the 2023 share issuance authorization, up to 10% of our issued share capital as of August 21, 2023 for a period of 18 months from October 5, 2023, which could cause existing shareholders to experience substantial dilution of their interest in us. In line with market practice for Dutch publicly traded companies, we expect to renew this authorization annually at our general meeting.

As of April 30, 2024, there were no preference shares issued or outstanding. Preference shares in the capital of the Company may currently be issued pursuant to a resolution adopted by the general meeting of shareholders at the proposal of the board of directors. Pre-emptive rights do not exist with respect to the issue of preference shares and holders of preference shares, if any, have no pre-emptive right to acquire newly issued ordinary shares. Also, preemptive rights do not exist with respect to the issue of shares or grant of rights to subscribe for shares to our employees or contributions in kind.

Sales of substantial amounts of our ordinary shares in the public markets, or the perception that they might occur, could reduce the price that our ordinary shares might otherwise attain.

Sales of a substantial number of shares of our ordinary shares in the public market, particularly sales by our directors, executive officers and significant shareholders, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our ordinary shares and may make it more difficult for you to sell your ordinary shares at a time and price that you deem appropriate.

We have also filed, and will file in the future, registration statements on Form S-8 under the Securities Act registering all ordinary shares that we may issue under our equity compensation plans, which may in turn be sold in the public market and may adversely affect the market price for our ordinary shares.

Certain anti-takeover provisions in our articles of association and under Dutch law may prevent or could make an acquisition of our company more difficult, limit attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove members of our board of directors and may adversely affect the market price of our ordinary shares.

Our articles of association contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company. These provisions could also make it difficult for shareholders to appoint directors that are not nominated by the current members of our board of directors or take other corporate actions, including effecting changes in our management. These provisions include:

- the staggered three-year terms of the members of our board of directors, as a result of which only approximately one-third of the members of our board of directors may be subject to election in any one year;
- a provision that the members of our board of directors may only be removed by a general meeting by a twothirds majority of votes cast representing at least 50% of our issued share capital if such removal is not proposed by our board of directors;
- a provision that the members of our board of directors may only be appointed upon binding nomination of the board of directors, which can only be overruled with a two-thirds majority of votes cast representing at least 50% of our issued share capital;
- requirements that certain matters, including an amendment of our articles of association, may only be brought to our shareholders for a vote upon a proposal by our board of directors; and
- minimum shareholding thresholds, based on nominal value, for shareholders to call general meetings of our shareholders or to add items to the agenda for those meetings.

We are subject to the Dutch Corporate Governance Code but do not comply with all the suggested governance provisions of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, which may affect your rights as a shareholder.

As a Dutch company, we are subject to the Dutch Corporate Governance Code ('DCGC'). The DCGC contains both principles and suggested governance provisions for management boards, supervisory boards, shareholders and general meetings, financial reporting, auditors, disclosure, compliance and enforcement standards. The DCGC is based on a 'comply or explain' principle. Accordingly, public companies are required to disclose in their annual reports, filed in the Netherlands, whether they comply with the suggested governance provisions of the DCGC. If they do not comply with those provisions, such as because of a conflicting requirement, companies are required to give the reasons for such noncompliance. The DCGC applies to all Dutch companies listed on a governmentrecognized stock exchange, whether in the Netherlands or elsewhere, including the NYSE. The principles and suggested governance provisions apply to our board of directors (in relation to role and composition, conflicts of interest and independence requirements, board committees and remuneration), shareholders and the general meeting (for example, regarding anti-takeover protection and our obligations to provide information to our shareholders) and financial reporting (such as external auditor and internal audit requirements). We aim to comply with all applicable provisions of the DCGC except where such provisions conflict with U.S. exchange listing requirements or with market practices in the United States or the Netherlands. This compliance position may affect your rights as a shareholder, and you may not have the same level of protection as a shareholder in a Dutch company that fully complies with the suggested governance provisions of the DCGC.

## We do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future, so your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our ordinary shares.

We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our shares. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings for use in the operation of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our ordinary shares in the foreseeable future. Were this position to change, payment of future dividends may be made only if our equity exceeds the amount of the paid-in and called-up part of the issued share capital, increased by the reserves required to be maintained by Dutch law or by our articles of association. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their ordinary shares after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments.

## Claims of U.S. civil liabilities may not be enforceable against us.

We are incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands and substantial portions of our assets are located outside of the United States. In addition, two members of our board of directors reside outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon us or such other persons residing outside the United States, or to enforce outside the United States judgments obtained against such persons in U.S. courts in any action, including actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws. In addition, it may be difficult for investors to enforce, in original actions brought in courts in jurisdictions located outside the United States, rights predicated upon the U.S. federal securities laws.

There is no treaty between the United States and the Netherlands for the mutual recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon the U.S. federal securities laws, would not be enforceable in the Netherlands unless the underlying claim is re-litigated before a Dutch court of competent jurisdiction. In such proceedings, however, a Dutch court may be expected to recognize the binding effect of a judgment of a federal or state court in the United States without re-examination of the substantive matters adjudicated thereby, if (i) the jurisdiction of the U.S. federal or state court has been based on internationally accepted principles of private international law, (ii) the judgment resulted from legal proceedings compatible with Dutch notions of due process, (iii) the judgment does not contravene public policy of the Netherlands and (iv) the judgment is not incompatible with (x) an earlier judgment of a Dutch court between the same parties, or (y) an earlier judgment of a foreign court between the same parties in a dispute regarding the same subject and based on the same cause, if that earlier foreign judgment is recognizable in the Netherlands.

Based on the foregoing, U.S. investors may not be able to enforce against us or members of our board of directors, officers or certain experts named in our filings with the SEC, who are residents of the Netherlands or countries other than the United States, any judgments obtained in U.S. courts in civil and commercial matters, including judgments under the U.S. federal securities laws.

In addition, there can be no assurance that a Dutch court would impose civil liability on us, the members of our board of directors, our officers or certain experts named in our filings with the SEC in an original action predicated solely upon the U.S. federal securities laws brought in a court of competent jurisdiction in the Netherlands against us or such members, officers or experts.

If industry or financial analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue inaccurate or unfavorable research regarding our ordinary shares, our share price and trading volume could decline, which could adversely affect our business.

The trading market for our ordinary shares is influenced by the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. We do not control these analysts, or the content and opinions included in their reports. If any of the analysts who cover us issues an inaccurate or unfavorable opinion regarding our company, our stock price would likely decline. Furthermore, investors and analysts may not understand how our consumption-based arrangements differ from a typical subscription-based pricing model. In addition, the stock prices of many companies in the technology industry have declined significantly after those companies have failed to meet, or significantly exceed, the financial guidance publicly announced by the companies or the expectations of analysts or public investors. If our financial results fail to meet, or significantly exceed, our announced guidance or the expectations of analysts or public investors, our stock price may decline. Analysts also could downgrade our ordinary shares or publish unfavorable research about us. If one or more of the analysts who cover our company ceases to cover us, or fails to publish reports on us regularly, our profile in the financial markets could decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline and could adversely affect our business.

If our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect, our results of operations could fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the trading price of our ordinary shares.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable

under the circumstances, as described in 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' included in this Report, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our results of operations may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our results of operations to fall below our publicly announced guidance or the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the market price of our ordinary shares. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition, deferred contract acquisition costs, acquired intangible assets, and income taxes.

## Risks Related to our Outstanding Senior Notes

## We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could adversely affect our financial condition.

We have a substantial amount of indebtedness and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future. As of April 30, 2024, we had $575.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.125% Senior Notes due July 15, 2029 (the 'Senior Notes') outstanding. Our indebtedness could have important consequences, including:

- limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements;
- requiring a portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes, thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;
- increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions; and
- increasing our cost of borrowing.

In addition, the indenture that governs the Senior Notes contains restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interest. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of substantially all of our indebtedness.

## We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.

Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and results of operations, which in turn are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on, among other factors, the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments and the indenture that governs the Senior Notes may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In the absence of such cash flows and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. Any of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Further, any future credit facility or other debt instrument may contain provisions that will restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from any such disposition. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations and any such failure to meet our scheduled debt service obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

The indenture that governs the Senior Notes contains, and any of our future debt instruments may contain, terms which restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions.

The indenture that governs the Senior Notes contains a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interest, including, among other things, restrictions on our ability to:

- create liens on certain assets to secure debt;
- grant a subsidiary guarantee of certain debt without also providing a guarantee of the Senior Notes; and
- consolidate or merge with or into, or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets to, another person.

The covenants in the indenture that governs the Senior Notes are subject to important exceptions and qualifications described in such indenture.

As a result of these restrictions, we are limited as to how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. The terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants and may require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests. We may not be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and, if we fail to do so, we may not be able to obtain waivers from the relevant lenders and/or amend the covenants.

Our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants described above and/or the terms of any future indebtedness from time to time could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in our being required to repay these borrowings before their due date. If we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or cannot refinance these borrowings, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. As a result, our failure to comply with such restrictive covenants could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

## We may be required to repurchase some of the Senior Notes upon a change of control triggering event.

Holders of the Senior Notes can require us to repurchase the Senior Notes upon a change of control (as defined in the indenture governing the Senior Notes) at a repurchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the applicable repurchase date. Our ability to repurchase the Senior Notes may be limited by law or the terms of other agreements relating to our indebtedness. In addition, we may not have sufficient funds to repurchase the Senior Notes or have the ability to arrange necessary financing on acceptable terms, if at all. A change of control may also constitute a default under, or result in the acceleration of the maturity of, our other then-existing indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase the Senior Notes would result in a default under the Senior Notes, which may result in the acceleration of the Senior Notes and other then-existing indebtedness. We may not have sufficient funds to make any payments triggered by such acceleration, which could result in foreclosure proceedings and our seeking protection under the U.S. bankruptcy code.

## General Risk Factors

## We may not benefit from our acquisition strategy.

As part of our business strategy, we may acquire or make investments in complementary companies, products, or technologies to augment our existing business. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or complete such acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. If we do complete acquisitions, we may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or achieve our goals and business strategy, we may be subject to claims or liabilities assumed from an acquired company, product, or technology, and any acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by our customers, investors, and securities analysts. In addition, if we are unsuccessful at integrating future acquisitions, or the technologies associated with such acquisitions, into our company, the revenue and results of operations of the combined company could be adversely affected. Any integration process may require significant time and resources, which may disrupt our ongoing business and divert management's attention from operations, and we may not be able to manage the integration process successfully. We may not successfully evaluate or utilize acquired technology or personnel, realize anticipated synergies from acquisitions, or accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction and integration of such acquisition, including accounting charges. We may have to pay cash, incur debt, or issue equity or equity-linked securities to pay for any future acquisitions, each of which could adversely affect our financial condition or the market price of our ordinary shares. The sale of equity or issuance of equity-linked debt to finance any future acquisitions could result in dilution to our shareholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations. We may acquire development stage companies that are not yet profitable, and that require continued investment, thereby reducing our cash available for other corporate purposes. The occurrence of any of these risks could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

## Catastrophic events, or man-made events such as terrorism, may disrupt our business.

A significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire, flood, or significant power outage, could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. The impact of climate change may increase these risks due to changes in weather patterns, such as increases in storm intensity, sea-level rise, melting of permafrost and temperature extremes in areas where we or our suppliers and customers conduct business. Some of our management members and other employees are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity, wildfires and other extreme weather events. If our or our partners' abilities are hindered by any of the foregoing events, we could experience sales delays, supply chain disruptions, and other negative impacts on

our business. In addition, acts of terrorism, acts of war, including the evolving conflict in Israel and Gaza and Russia's war with Ukraine, other geopolitical unrest or health issues, such as a pandemic outbreak, or fear of such events, could cause disruptions in our business or the business of our partners, customers or the economy as a whole. Any disruption in the business of our partners or customers that affects sales in a fiscal quarter could have a significant adverse impact on our quarterly results for that and future quarters. All of the aforementioned risks may be further increased if our disaster recovery plans prove to be inadequate.

## Our reputation and/or business could be negatively impacted by ESG matters and/or our reporting of such matters.

There is an increasing focus from regulators, certain investors, customers, and other stakeholders concerning ESG matters, both in the United States and internationally, and companies across all industries are experiencing increased scrutiny of their ESG practices, positions, and reporting. Investors, customers, regulators, employees, and other stakeholders have focused increasingly on ESG issues, including, among other matters, climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, human and civil rights, and DEI matters. Expectations surrounding appropriate corporate behavior in these areas are continually evolving and often reflect a wide spectrum of viewpoints and interests. In addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to ESG matters are evolving, creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time-consuming. We communicate certain ESG-related initiatives and goals regarding ESG in our annual sustainability report, on our website, in our filings with the SEC, and elsewhere. These initiatives and goals, coupled with the uncertainty regarding compliance with evolving ESG laws, regulations and expectations, could be difficult to achieve and costly to implement. We could fail to achieve, or be perceived to fail to achieve, our ESG-related initiatives and goals. In addition, we could be criticized for the timing, scope or nature of these initiatives and goals, or for any revisions to them. If our ESG practices and disclosures do not meet evolving investor, customer, or other stakeholder expectations and societal and regulatory standards, or if we experience an actual or perceived failure to achieve our ESG-related initiatives and goals our ability to attract or retain employees and our attractiveness as an investment or as a business partner could be negatively impacted, which could adversely affect our business.

We are, or in the future will be, obligated to comply with new stringent climate-related reporting requirements under California climate-related reporting statutes, laws of member states of the European Union implementing the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, and other laws and regulations. These sustainability reporting frameworks will require us to provide, at least annually, detailed public disclosures about the greenhouse gas emissions and other climate-related effects our activities produce, the climate-related operating and financial risks we face, and the strategies we pursue to reduce and adapt to the impacts of climate change. We expect to incur substantial costs to prepare these disclosures. If we fail to compile, assess and report the required operating and accounting information in a timely manner and in accordance with mandatory reporting standards, we could be exposed to fines and other sanctions and sustain harm to our reputation.

If we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, and investor confidence and the market price of our ordinary shares may decline, which could adversely affect our business.

As a public company in the United States, we are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we have expended and anticipate that we will continue to expend significant resources, including accounting-related costs and significant management oversight. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant expenses and devote substantial management effort toward compliance with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. To assist us in complying with these requirements, we may need to hire more employees in the future, or engage outside consultants, which will increase our operating expenses.

Despite significant investment, our current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. Further, weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to implement or maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement could harm our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could also adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that are required to be included in our periodic reports that we file with the SEC.

Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, subject us to sanctions or investigations by the NYSE, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities, and would likely cause the trading price of our ordinary shares to decline, which could adversely affect our business.

## Risk Management and Control Systems

Elastic, similar to other technology companies, operates in a complex, competitive, and rapidly changing environment that involves many risks. In addition to general market, research and development, and economic risks, the Group faces potential risks related to its industry, information technology and cybersecurity, data privacy, financial controls and reporting, compliance with applicable laws and regulations, finances and taxation, global operations, environment and social responsibility, and product portfolio and commercialization, among others. As a company committed to operating ethically and with integrity, we proactively seek to manage and, where possible, mitigate risks to help ensure compliance with applicable rules and regulations, maintain integrity and continuity in our operations and business, and protect our assets. Risk management is an enterprise-wide objective subject to oversight by the Board and its committees.

It is the responsibility of Elastic's management and employees to implement and administer risk-management processes to identify material risks to our business. In addition, management must assess, manage and monitor those risks, all while maintaining flexibility in how we operate. To further embed risk management and compliance into our culture, Elastic implements relevant policies and procedures and trains employees on how to implement and comply with them. All of our committees have regular access to management and our Board and committees also schedule sessions without members of management present.

Elastic's Board, in turn, directly or through its committees, oversees management's implementation of risk management. We have our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics ("Code of Conduct") and other related policies in place, and the Board and its committees rigorously review with management actual and potential significant risks, including any breaches of the Code of Conduct, at least quarterly.

Based on its oversight activities, reports from management and third parties, and extensive discussions and analyses, the Board believes that (i) the Company's internal risk management and control systems provide reasonable assurance that the Company's financial reporting does not contain any errors of material importance, (ii) based on the current state of affairs, it is justified that the Company's financial reporting is prepared on a going concern basis and (iii) this report states material risks and uncertainties relevant to the expectation of the Company's continuity for the period of twelve months after the preparation of this report. The Board has no reason to believe that there are material shortcomings associated with the Company's internal risk management and control systems that would otherwise have to be disclosed in this report. Consequently, those systems have not been materially revised during the fiscal year to which this report pertains and no material improvements thereto are scheduled. The Company's internal risk management and control systems have been discussed with the audit committee and the non-executive directors.

Fraud Risk: Elastic uses the Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or COSO, as a reference for its design, implementation, and evaluation of control activities as part of a system of internal control. Elastic has implemented internal risk management and control systems to manage the risks effectively and efficiently. An example is fraud risk prevention, which starts with the identification of potential internal and external fraud risk scenarios. Identification, analysis and determination of the internal and external fraud risks relevant to the Group is performed, followed by the nature and inherent size of these risks. Subsequently, the relevant controls that are in place are mapped to the risks. Finally, a conclusion of the overall residual risk and an assessment is made to what extent the remaining residual risk is within Elastic's risk appetite.

Elastic 's key internal fraud risk scenarios include the manipulation of financial results, the misuse of confidential information, and the misappropriation of assets. Elastic's key external fraud risk scenarios include customers providing Elastic with fraudulent documents, circumvention of Elastic's fraud prevention system through brute force or fraud rings, and customers initiating fraudulent transactions. Relevant mitigating controls mapped to these risks include both preventive and detective controls that sufficiently mitigate internal and external fraud risk scenarios.

Credit Risk : The nature of the Group's operations is such that its customer base is sufficiently diversified and generally financially secure and that, accordingly, credit risk is limited. In addition, management regularly reviews aging of accounts receivable and has implemented procedures to ensure that cash is collected on time.

Liquidity Risk : In the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, we generated cash from operations of $134.7 million and $30.9 million, respectively. Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Group's cash and cash equivalents on the basis of expected cash flows. This is generally carried out at the Group level, taking into account the liquidity of the market in which Group's subsidiaries operate.

We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operating and capital needs for at least the next 12 months, despite the uncertainty in the changing market and macroeconomic conditions. Our assessment of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could vary as a result of, and our future capital requirements, both near-term and long-term, will depend on, many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support our research and development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing of

new introductions of solutions or features, and the continuing market acceptance of our solutions and services. We may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services and technologies, including intellectual property rights. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. In July 2021, we issued long-term debt of $575.0 million, and we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, or if we cannot expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities because we lack sufficient capital, our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.

## Risk Appetite

Our risk appetite is integrated into the business through our strategy, global policies, procedures, controls, and budgets. While the executive directors are responsible for overseeing and managing the Company's dayto-day risks and related control systems, the Board has broad oversight of the Company's risk profile and risk management. Our appetite for risk varies depending on the risk type. The Group measures risk by estimating the potential for loss of profit, staff turnover, and reputational damage. Our appetite for each risk is determined by considering key opportunities and potential threats to achieving our strategic objectives and can be categorized as follows:

## Operational

Operational risks include unforeseen incidents that could result from failures in internal processes or systems, human error, forecasting, or adverse external events and could negatively impact the day-to-day operation of our business.

## Risk appetite: Moderate

Operational risks are managed through management oversight, the ongoing budgeting, forecasting, and reporting process as well as training activities to constantly improve and update employees' skills and knowledge. Infrastructural operational risks are managed by regular backups and increased use of the cloud.

The cost of these measures and control systems must be commensurate with the benefits achieved. Management generally considers the likelihood of risks in the operational and technology areas as moderate while evaluating the financial impact of each event depending on the specific risk field. Management's risk appetite in this field is moderate and we seek to mitigate risks through contracts, service level agreements, insurance, and cooperation with established partners.

We strive to minimize the possibility of business disruptions and the related impact of operational failures. We constantly review and invest in our structure and processes to ensure they are fit for purpose and address any identified operational risk.

## Strategic

Strategic risks originate from trends, developments, or events that could prevent us from executing and realizing our strategic objectives and include risks related to personnel, customer dependency, and the market.

## Risk appetite: Moderate

As far as strategic risks are concerned, we try to mitigate personnel risk by providing an attractive remuneration package, a positive working environment, and structured individual development plans. We try to manage the dependency risk by building and maintaining customer relationships. We develop customer engagement strategies and regularly monitor progress for existing customers and identify and build relationships with new customers.

In general, management addresses market risks by actively monitoring the developments and evaluating the actual exposure to these risks. This includes hiring industry qualified executives and employees, participation in industry events, gaining information from analysts and research firms as well as creating business cases for new product developments. The Group does not pursue growth at all costs and expects sufficient margins. We will primarily pursue organic growth strategies to meet our growth objectives. We aim for sufficient operating margins while protecting the long-term viability of the Group.

## Financial

Financial risks include uncertainty of financial returns on investments, reductions in liquidity, erosion of profits, potential financial losses due to financing policies, and other external factors such as the macroeconomic environment and geopolitical conditions, unreliability of suppliers, economic restrictions, and reduction of the customer base.

## Risk appetite: Low

In the field of financial risks, management addresses the low profitability risk mainly through transparency and a permanent review process in connection with quarterly results, forecasting, and budgeting considering both internal factors and external factors such as macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions. In the event of

merger and acquisition ("M&amp;A") activity, a dedicated project management team is established for accelerating sustainable long-term value creation. Through a strong due diligence process and closely managed integration process, we seek to reduce the probability of M&amp;A-related risk. Currency risks, on the other hand, can be minimized through natural hedging due to having revenue and costs for business conducts outside of the United States incurred in the local currency of the associated subsidiary, however, to date, we have not had a formal hedging program with respect to foreign currency, but we may adopt such a program in the future if our exposure to foreign currency should become more significant. Our revenue and expenses are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, and to a lesser extent the Euro, British Pound Sterling, and other currencies. Although changes to exchange rates of foreign currencies have not had a material impact on our net operating results to date, we continue to reassess our foreign exchange exposure as we continue to grow our business globally. As far as political instability is concerned, the breadth of our offerings and geographical reach helps to mitigate our exposure to any particular localized risk. We monitor proposed changes in taxation legislation and new accounting standards to ensure these are taken into account when we consider our future business plans. We manage working capital risk by increasing and diversifying our customer base and carefully managing our costs. While the Group has sufficient cash to meet its future obligations, it may seek additional external funding in the future, and we consider the risk of not being able to secure additional funding as a risk that is not imminent. While Management's risk appetite for financial risk is low overall, management realizes that the expansion of the business does require some risk-taking and evaluates risk appetite for business expansion as medium.

## Compliance

Compliance risks relate to unanticipated failures to comply with applicable laws and regulations as well as our own policies and procedures.

## Risk appetite: Low

The Group is committed to complying with the laws and regulations of the countries in which we operate. However, as the Group is expanding its business in a complex and rapidly changing international environment, and is continuously improving its processes and procedures, regulatory violations may occur. We are well aware that legal and regulatory standards are constantly evolving, compliance obligations are increasing significantly, and financial penalties for non-compliance in certain areas relevant to the Group (such as privacy, international trade, or anti-corruption) could be very high. Management's risk appetite is low and matters of substantial significance are reviewed with the Board or a committee of the Board. However, should the risk materialize, it could have a very high, potentially critical impact. We mitigate the risk by constantly enhancing our business integrity program (including compliance policies, training, monitoring, internal reporting, etc.) and working with well-established external partners such as tax, legal, and audit advisors.

## Tax Strategy of Elasticsearch Limited ('Elastic UK')

This section outlines the approach adopted by Elastic UK in managing its tax obligations and activities. In making this tax strategy available, Elastic UK is fulfilling its responsibilities under paragraph 22(2) of Schedule 19 of the Finance Act 2016. It will be reviewed annually and updated as appropriate for legislative developments in the United Kingdom ('UK').

## Tax Governance and Risk Management

Elastic N.V., the parent entity of Elastic UK, employs an experienced global tax team. For direct corporate income, this team is led in the United States ('U.S.') by the Vice President of Tax and Treasury of Elastic. For indirect tax matters, the team is based in the UK, the Netherlands, the U.S., and Singapore under the Vice President, Assistant Controller of Elastic. Our global tax team is part of the accounting function reporting to the Chief Accounting Officer of Elastic.

The tax team is accountable for day-to-day management of tax matters. Any decisions to be made in respect of uncertain tax issues will be subject to diligent professional care and judgment by the tax team. Elastic UK uses external tax advisors to provide the expert guidance necessary to assess tax risks and to ensure its compliance with applicable tax laws and regulations.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of Elastic receives updates as to material changes in tax legislation that may impact the organization as well as details of uncertain tax positions.

## Tax Planning Considerations

At all times, Elastic UK aims to comply with applicable tax obligations and laws in all jurisdictions and to act in a way which upholds its reputation as a responsible corporate body.

All intra-group transactions are conducted on an arm's length basis and in accordance with the other guidelines laid down by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and in line with other domestic legislation and documentation requirements.

We are committed to conducting our tax affairs to the highest standards and in line with the Elastic's code of conduct, while also complying with all applicable anti-bribery, money laundering, and anti-tax evasion

legislation. We foster an open, honest, and constructive relationship with tax authorities whom we deal with. Our objective is to ensure that all filing positions are supported by strong technical grounds and, where clear, in the spirit of what the law is understood to have intended. Elastic does not engage in tax planning that lacks an independent business purpose. We will, however, claim properly available allowances, deductions, reliefs, credits, and incentives as appropriate.

## Level of Acceptable Risk in Relation to UK Taxation

Elastic UK is not prescriptive about the level of tax risk which is acceptable for its business but is committed to paying the right amount of tax at the correct time. Elastic UK seeks to operate its tax affairs based on sound commercial principles and in accordance with relevant tax legislation. Elastic UK appropriately reviews and documents all of its material tax positions. Elastic UK believes that it does not pursue aggressive tax planning arrangements.

## Relationship with HM Revenue &amp; Customs ('HMRC')

Elastic UK engages with taxing authorities, including HMRC, in a cooperative and compliant manner. We seek to make full and accurate disclosures in tax returns and in all correspondence with HMRC. Elastic UK will seek to resolve any disputed matters through proactive and transparent discussion with HMRC.

## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

## Dutch Corporate Governance Code

Elastic is committed to good corporate governance and has implemented a robust governance structure that the Board believes remains most appropriate for the Company. As a Dutch company, Elastic's governance practices are governed by the DCGC, certain provisions of the Dutch Civil Code, and other Dutch and European Union laws and regulations, as applicable. Additionally, because Elastic's ordinary shares are traded on the NYSE, Elastic also complies with the applicable listing standards of the NYSE in addition to U.S. securities laws.

Elastic complies with the relevant principles and best practice provisions of the DCGC (which are not binding, but apply on a 'comply or explain' basis), except for the following:

Hierarchical Reporting of Internal Audit Function (best practice provisions under chapter 1)

Pursuant to the written charter of our Audit Committee, our internal audit function reports the results of its audit to the Company's executive directors and to the Audit Committee in accordance with the DCGC. The internal audit function, however, reports hierarchically to the CFO, who is not a member of the Board. We deem this reporting line most efficient as the CFO has the expertise required to oversee the internal audit department. The CFO reports directly to the CEO.

Remuneration (best practice provisions under chapter 3)

Consistent with Elastic's historical practices and market practices in the U.S., the trading jurisdiction of our ordinary shares, and in order to further support Elastic's ability to attract and retain the right highly qualified candidates for a board position:

1. We have granted options and restricted stock units to non-executive directors and intend to continue to grant restricted stock units to non-executive directors. The options provide for vesting conditions which allow exercise of the options within the first three years of their grant date. Furthermore, the restricted stock units are not subject to a five-year holding period. Elastic's directors generally may sell their vested shares at any time, subject to company policy and applicable securities regulations. Such remuneration is in accordance with the NYSE corporate governance requirements and market practice among companies listed on the NYSE. We are in competition with other companies in this field, and we intend to maintain an attractive compensation package for our current and future board members so that we can remain competitive.
2. The agreements with our executive directors provide for (i) a severance payment in excess of oneyear base salary in certain events and (ii) a severance payment if such agreement is terminated at the initiative of such executive director. We believe these severance provisions are consistent with U.S. market practice.

Majority requirements for dismissal and setting-aside binding nominations (best practice provision under chapter 4)

Pursuant to our articles of association, directors are appointed by the general meeting on a binding nomination by the Board. A resolution of the General Meeting to overrule such binding nomination requires at least two-thirds of the votes cast representing more than half of our issued share capital. Although in deviation from the suggested governance provision, this is in line with article 2:133 (2) of the Dutch Civil Code, which provides for the same majority and quorum requirements as included in our articles of association, and is considered to promote continuity within the Board. A two-thirds majority representing more than half of our issued share capital is also required for the dismissal of a director if such dismissal has not been proposed by the Board. Although in deviation from suggested corporate governance provisions, this is in line with article 2:134 (2) of the Dutch Civil Code.

## Other Codes of Conduct or Corporate Governance Practices

In addition to the DCGC, Elastic is subject to and complies with our Code of Conduct and Corporate Governance Guidelines. The texts of Elastic's Code of Conduct and Corporate Governance Guidelines are publicly available on the Corporate Governance page of our Investor Relations website at ir.elastic.co.

## General Meeting of Shareholders

The General Meeting is held in the Netherlands at the place where we have our corporate seat (Amsterdam), at Haarlemmermeer (Schiphol Airport), Rotterdam, or The Hague (the Netherlands). The annual General Meeting is held no later than six months after the end of the financial year on the date and hour and at the place mentioned in the convening notice. Additional extraordinary General Meetings may also be held whenever considered appropriate by the Board. Pursuant to Dutch law, one or more shareholders and others entitled to attend a General Meeting, who jointly represent at least one-tenth of the issued share capital, may request the Board to convene a General Meeting. If the Board has not taken the steps necessary to ensure that a General Meeting is held within the relevant statutory period after the request, the requesting person(s) may, at their request, be authorized by a court in preliminary relief proceedings to convene a General Meeting.

General Meetings are convened by a notice, which includes an agenda stating the items to be discussed, including for the annual General Meeting, among other things, the discussion and adoption of the annual accounts, appropriation of our profits and proposals relating to the board of directors, including the filling of any vacancies in the Board. In addition, the agenda includes such items as have been included therein by the Board. One or more shareholders, alone or together, representing at least three percent of the issued share capital may also request to include items in the agenda of a General Meeting. Requests must be made in writing and received by the Board at least sixty days before the day of the meeting. No resolutions will be adopted on items other than those which have been included in the agenda. In accordance with the DCGC, a shareholder may request the inclusion of an item on the agenda only after consulting the Board in that respect. If one or more shareholders intends to request that an item be put on the agenda for a General Meeting that may result in a change in the company's strategy, pursuant to the DCGC the Board may invoke a response time of a maximum of one hundred and eighty days. Furthermore, with respect to certain shareholder proposals, the Board may invoke a response time of a maximum of two hundred and fifty days in accordance with article 2:114b of the Dutch Civil Code.

The General Meeting is presided over by the non-executive director designated as lead independent director, or the Lead Independent Director, or, if such director is absent, by the vice chairperson of the board of directors. Members of the Board may attend a General Meeting. In these meetings, they have an advisory vote. The chairperson of the meeting may decide at their discretion to admit other persons to the meeting.

The external auditor of the company may attend the annual General Meeting in which the annual accounts are discussed.

## Board of Directors

The board of directors of the Company is responsible for establishing broad corporate policies and overseeing the overall performance of the Company. The board of directors selects the Company's senior management, delegates authority for the conduct of the Company's day-to-day operations to senior management, and monitors their performance. Members of the board of directors exercise their oversight role by, among other actions, participating in meetings of the board of directors and committees and by reviewing analyses and reports provided to them.

We have a one-tier board of directors, consisting of executive and non-executive directors. The board of directors determines the number of executive and non-executive directors.

The board of directors is currently composed of nine directors. We have two executive directors, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Technology Officer, and seven non-executive directors.

We have a classified board of directors in which directors serve for staggered terms. Under the Company's articles of association, each director may be appointed for a maximum term of three years, provided that the director's term will lapse immediately after the close of the first annual general meeting held after three years (or less if the term is shorter than three years) have lapsed since the director's appointment, or until the director's earlier death, resignation or removal. A director may be reappointed, and the three-year maximum term may be deviated from, by resolution of the general meeting of shareholders upon a proposal of the board of directors.

As of August 21, 2024, the Board was composed as follows:

| Name                     |   Age | Position                                                         | Nationality   | Self-Identified Ethnicity   | Date of Appointment   |   Term expires (AGM held in) |

## Steven Schuurman

## Background and Experience

Steven Schuurman co-founded our Company and has served as a member of our board of directors since July 2012 and previously served as our CEO from July 2012 to May 2017. Mr. Schuurman serves on the boards of various private companies.

## Qualifications

Mr. Schuurman holds a B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from TH Rijswijk, now known as The Hague University of Applied Sciences.

The board of directors believes that Mr. Schuurman is qualified to serve as a member of our board of directors because of his deep understanding of our business, operations, and strategy due to his role as our co-founder and former CEO.

During fiscal year April 30, 2024, the board of directors held four meetings (including regularly scheduled and special meetings), and all of our directors attended at least 75% of the aggregate of (i) the total number of meetings of our board of directors held during the period for which they served and (ii) the total number of meetings held by all committees of our board of directors on which they served during the periods for which they served. During fiscal year 2024, the board of directors also acted by written consent in lieu of a meeting.

Although we do not have a formal policy regarding attendance by members of our board of directors at annual general meetings of shareholders, we encourage our directors to attend these meetings. Of the nine directors then serving on the board of directors, six directors attended the annual general meeting of shareholders on October 5, 2023.

## Activities of and Evaluation by the Non-Executive Directors

The non-executive directors have overseen management and the functioning of the Board, and provided advice to our executive directors and senior management, including overseeing the executive directors and senior management's execution of Elastic's strategy and monitoring the general affairs of the Company and business connected with it as described in the Company's relevant governance documents. The directors on the Board and its committees received extensive information and input from multiple layers of management and external advisors, engaged in detailed and robust discussion and analysis regarding matters brought before them (including in executive session) and consistently and actively engaged in the development and approval of significant corporate strategies.

All non-executive directors regularly attended meetings of the Company's board of directors held during the fiscal year to which this report pertains.

The non-executive directors, assisted by the nominating and corporate governance committee, have discussed at least once during the fiscal year to which this report pertains (i) their own functioning, the functioning of the Board committees and the individual members thereof, and discussed the conclusions that may be drawn on the basis thereof, (ii) the desired profile, composition and competence of the Board, and (iii) the functioning of the Board and the performance by the individual directors of their duties, and discussed the conclusions that may be drawn on the basis thereof.

The non-executive directors also discussed the Company's strategy and the main risks associated with its business, the results of the evaluation by the Board of the design and effectiveness of the internal risk management and control systems, as well as any significant changes thereto.

The Board and each committee conduct an annual self-evaluation by their respective members. These evaluations are intended to facilitate an examination and discussion by the entire Board and each committee of its effectiveness as a group in fulfilling its charter requirements and other responsibilities, its performance, and areas for improvement. The nominating and corporate governance committee supervises the format for each annual self-evaluation and, as appropriate, may use evaluation results in assessing and recommending the characteristics and critical skills required of prospective candidates for election to the Board and making recommendations with respect to assignments of its members to various committees.

The evaluation described above takes place based on the aforementioned self-evaluation.

The Board has discussed the conclusions from the evaluation described above. The main conclusion was that, overall, our directors are satisfied with the functioning of, and their respective memberships of, the Board and, where relevant, its committees. The evaluation included a review of charters of the standing Board committees and certain of our other governance-related documents.

The Board and/or individual members will participate from time to time in director educational seminars, conferences and other director education programs presented by external and internal resources, on matters that may relate to, among other topics, compensation, governance, risk oversight, including cybersecurity risk management, business, industry, audit and accounting, credit and financial, regulatory and other current issues confronting boards of directors of public companies.

## Committees of the Board

The Board has the authority to appoint committees to perform certain management and administrative functions. The Board has established an audit committee, a compensation committee and a nominating and corporate governance committee, each of which has the composition and responsibilities described below. Members will serve on these committees until their resignation or until otherwise determined by the Board. Executive directors may not be members of the audit committee, compensation committee or the nominating and corporate governance committee.

## Diversity

We recognize the importance of diversity and we believe that our business benefits from a wide range of skills and a variety of different backgrounds, and that a diverse composition contributes to a well-balanced decision-making process by the Board and our senior management team. In September 2018, the Board adopted a diversity, equity, and inclusion policy (last amended in June 2023) (the "DEI Policy") with respect to the composition of the Board and our senior management team, considering characteristics such as nationality, age, gender, race, ethnicity, education and professional background, among others.

In recommending candidates to the board of directors, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee takes into consideration the board of directors' criteria for selecting new directors described above, as well as such factors as the candidate's integrity, judgment, intelligence, and ability to devote adequate time to duties of the board of directors. The committee does not assign specific weights to particular criteria. No particular criterion is a prerequisite for any candidate.

In July 2022, we amended our DEI Policy to reflect that it is our objective to increase the gender diversity within the Board such that the Board, as well as the sub-group of executive directors and the sub-group of non-executive directors, shall consist of at least ⅓ female directors and at least ⅓ male directors. The Board currently comprises three female directors and six male directors. The composition of the Board meets the diversity objectives with respect to the Board as a whole and the sub-group of non-executive directors, but does not currently meet the diversity objective with respect to the sub-group of executive directors. Additionally our DEI Policy includes an objective to have our senior management team (excluding executive directors that are part of our senior management team) consist of at least ⅓ female members and at least ⅓ male members. In April 2023 we amended our policy to reflect that our diversity objectives as amended in July 2022 are also our ambition for purposes of Dutch law. While we present gender diversity objectives by men and women in accordance with Dutch legislation, we acknowledge this is not fully encompassing of all gender identities.

The Board considers diversity in reviewing director and senior management team candidates and does not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, sexual orientation, sex or national origin. However, in order for the Board to fulfill its responsibilities, our nominating and corporate governance committee believes that the Board should first of all include directors that possess a blend of experience, knowledge and ability, regardless of other characteristics. Mses. Gleeson, Leibowitz and Marooney were nominated for appointment to the Board based on their experience, knowledge and ability. Their appointments have also improved the gender diversity within the Board, which is composed in accordance with our DEI Policy. The Board takes into account Elastic's DEI Policy when selecting and instructing a search firm to assist in our search for new directors.

The Board takes into account the same considerations when reviewing senior management team candidates. Our senior management team does not currently consist of at least 1/3 female members, with two of seven

members, excluding our executive directors, being female, but we continue working towards our long-term goal of achieving more gender diversity among our senior management team.

To achieve these goals, we focus on enhancing our recruiting and retention and development practices as guided by the three pillars of our diversity, equity, and inclusion ('DEI') strategy: People, Product, Plus. More details can be found on our DEI efforts and our DEI philosophy in our 2023 Sustainability Report available at sustainability.elastic.co.

With respect to recruiting, we partner with organizations such as CIRCA, the USA's largest network of community-based organizations, PowerToFly, and Fairygodboss to help us reach diverse candidates and our internal sourcers and recruiters focus outreach and sourcing efforts on finding diverse talent. Our recruiting approach is underpinned by the desire to create balanced teams at Elastic, which includes considering broad aspects of diversity from race and gender mix as well as diversity of thought, experience and tenure when recruiting new team members.

With respect to retention and development, we have a learning and organizational development team focused on enabling purposeful growth for all Elastic employees by providing meaningful learning that can be applied in work and life. We strive to be an employer of choice for a diverse and inclusive workforce through our talent brand and talent attraction, development, and retention efforts. We strive to embed DEI deep within our culture through various initiatives, projects and programs, the centerpiece of which is the Elastician Resource Groups, which are company sponsored, self-organized, employee-run groups aligned to specific shared identities, interests, affinity or allyship. Our seven ERGs encompass: Accessibility, Black and African American, Asian and Pacific Islander+, Hispanic/Latinx, LTGBQIA+, Military/Veteran, and Women. We also pursue fair and consistent pay practices with an emphasis on employee well-being. Fair pay is the foundation of our compensation philosophy and the goal of fair pay informs our pay decisions around the globe. This means paying people fairly for the job they perform without regard to gender, race, or ethnicity. We partner with an external firm to conduct pay equity analysis on a regular basis using established job groupings and control factors to promote appropriate comparisons. We look at gender globally and race and ethnicity for employees in the U.S. Additionally, outside of the United States, we conduct supplemental country-specific analysis in accordance with local requirements. Further recognizing that transparency is fundamental in fostering an equitable workplace where employees can trust that their compensation is based on fair and objective criteria, we provide all employees with information about the full salary range for their role. Throughout the United States and Canada, we also include salary ranges on all job postings, in all states and provinces.

In addition to the above, we make achieving our diversity objectives a priority by supporting DEI at Elastic at the top. Our senior director of DEI, who is responsible for integration of DEI in the company reports to the Chief Human Resources Officer, who in turn reports to the compensation committee of the Board on matters relating to DEI topics.

## REMUNERATION REPORT

Pursuant to Section 2:135(1) DCC, our General Meeting has adopted a remuneration policy for our Board members (the 'Remuneration Policy').

In this Remuneration Report, an overview is provided of the Remuneration Policy for the Board and the application thereof in fiscal 2024. For details regarding the remuneration of the Board in fiscal 2024, see Consolidated Financial Statements - Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 30 Related parties .

## Remuneration Policy

The Remuneration Policy supports the long-term development of the Company in a highly dynamic environment, while aiming to fulfill all stakeholders' requirements and keeping an acceptable risk profile.

The purpose of the Remuneration Policy is to define a competitive remuneration package, designed to attract, retain, and motivate directors who possess the necessary leadership qualities and the requisite skills and experience in the various aspects of the Company's business. The policy acknowledges the internal and external context as well as our business needs and long-term strategy. The policy is designed to encourage behavior that is focused on sustainable long-term value creation, while adopting the highest standards of good corporate governance. The policy is aimed at motivating outstanding achievements, using a combination of non-financial and financial performance measures.

The policy aims to ensure that directors' interests are closely aligned to those of the Company's stakeholders, including the shareholders, and to incentivize directors to achieve short-term and long-term objectives of substantially increasing the Company's equity value. When determining director remuneration, the compensation committee and the Board take into consideration the Company's strategy and core values, which are focused on long-term direction and continuity, and address the interests of all of the Company's stakeholders.

The Board is currently not contemplating to propose any change to the Remuneration Policy or the implementation thereof in the upcoming fiscal years.

## Remuneration of Executive Directors

The remuneration package for the executive directors is determined by the non-executive directors on the Board, without any involvement of any executive director, in accordance with the Remuneration Policy and the compensation committee charter.

Executive director remuneration includes a fixed base salary and a variable component comprised of shortterm and long-term variable incentives. An executive director also receives certain minimal perquisites and retirement and health benefits, as well as severance payment or change of control protections.

- Fixed component: base salary: The base salary of the executive directors is set at a competitive level, taking into account the skills, competencies, experience, scope of duties and performance of the executive director.
- Variable remuneration: The executive directors are granted variable compensation in the form of short-term and long-term incentives. The objective of the performance-related variable remuneration payment is to incentivize and reward strong short-term and long-term financial and personal performance and the implementation of strategic imperatives.
- o Short-term incentive : A short-term incentive generally consists of an annual performancebased cash bonus. The performance test includes criteria reflecting the Company's financial performance and may also include quantitative or qualitative criteria related to the Company's non-financial performance or to individual performance, or both, as set out in the Company's executive incentive compensation plan (the 'Bonus Plan'), or any successor plan or arrangement adopted and implemented by the Company. The non-executive directors on the Board may also award cash bonuses to an executive director for specific transactions that the non-executive directors on the Board, in their discretion, deems exceptional in terms of strategic importance and effect on the Company's results.
- o Long-term incentive - equity compensation : Long-term incentives are granted under the Company's then-current stock option plan, which upon adoption of this policy is the 'Option Plan' setting out the appropriate terms and conditions under which various equity-based incentives can be awarded. In determining the long-term incentive component of an executive director's remuneration, the compensation committee and/or the non-executive directors on the Board consider any factors that they deem relevant. The Company uses equity awards to incentivize and reward the executive officers for long-term corporate performance based on the value of the Company's ordinary shares and, thereby, to align the executive director's interests with the interests of our shareholders. The realized value of these equity awards bears a direct relationship to the Company's share price, and, therefore, these awards are an incentive for the executive directors to create value for our shareholders. Equity awards also help the Company retain our senior officers in a highly

competitive market and as such contribute to the long-term value creation for all of the Company's stakeholders.

- For example, in fiscal 2024, we issued equity compensation in the form of restricted stock units and performance share units to our executive directors. These forms of long-term incentives issued are based on the achievement of certain criteria such as continued service and the Company's attainment of a certain amount of total revenue in fiscal 2024. Additional information on our equity compensation restricted stock units and performance share units can be found in the Company's proxy statement filed with the SEC, which is available on the Company's website.
- o Executive Incentive Compensation Plan : The Company has a Bonus Plan that allows the compensation committee and/or the non-executive directors on the Board to provide cash incentive awards to executive directors and selected employees, based upon performance goals established by the compensation committee. The Bonus Plan enables the compensation committee to provide cash incentive awards to selected employees, including our Named Executive Officers (other than the executive directors), based upon the Company's actual achievement as measured against performance metrics established by the compensation committee. In the case of the executive directors, the performance metrics for their cash incentive awards and the actual payment of the awards are established by the non-executive directors serving on the Board, upon the recommendation from the compensation committee.

Under the Bonus Plan, the compensation committee will determine the performance goals applicable to any award, which goals may include, without limitation: (i) attainment of research and development milestones, (ii) bookings, (iii) business divestitures and acquisitions, (iv) calculated billings, (v) cash flow, (vi) cash position, (vii) contract awards or backlog, (viii) customer renewals, (ix) customer retention rates from an acquired company, subsidiary, business unit or division, (x) earnings (which may include earnings before interest and taxes, earnings before taxes, and net taxes), (xi) earnings per share, (xii) expenses, (xiii) gross margin, (xiv) growth in stockholder value relative to the moving average of the S&amp;P 500 Index or another index, (xv) internal rate of return, (xvi) market share, (xvii) net income, (xviii) net profit, (xix) net sales, (xx) new product development, (xxi) new product invention or innovation, (xxii) number of customers, (xxiii) operating cash flow, (xxiv) operating expenses, (xxv) operating income, (xxvi) operating margin, (xxvii) overhead or other expense reduction, (xxviii) product defect measures, (xxix) product release timelines, (xxx) productivity, (xxxi) profit, (xxxii) retained earnings, (xxxiii) return on assets, (xxxiv) return on capital, (xxxv) return on equity, (xxxvi) return on investment, (xxxvii) return on sales, (xxxviii) revenue, (xxxix) revenue growth, (xl) sales results, (xli) sales growth, (xlii) stock price, (xliii) time to market, (xliv) total stockholder return, (xlv) working capital, and (xlvi) individual objectives such as peer reviews or other subjective or objective criteria.

The compensation committee believes that the financial performance measures used in the Bonus Plan contribute to driving the creation of long-term stakeholder value, including shareholder value, and play an important role in influencing the performance of the executive directors and other officers of the Company that participate in the plan, who are most directly responsible for our overall success.

Performance goals that include the Company's financial results may be determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ('GAAP') or such financial results may consist of non-GAAP financial measures and any actual results may be adjusted by the compensation committee for one-time items or unbudgeted or unexpected items when determining whether the performance goals have been met. The goals may be on the basis of any factors the compensation committee determines relevant, and may be adjusted on an individual, divisional, business unit or company wide basis. The performance goals may differ from participant to participant and from award to award.

The compensation committee may, in its sole discretion and at any time, increase, reduce or eliminate a participant's actual award, and/or increase, reduce or eliminate the amount allocated to the bonus pool for a particular performance period. The actual award may be below, at or above a participant's target award, at the compensation committee's discretion. The compensation committee may determine the amount of any reduction on the basis of such factors as it deems relevant, and it is not required to establish any allocation or weighting with respect to the factors it considers.

Actual awards will be paid in cash only after they are earned, which, unless otherwise determined by the compensation committee, requires continued employment through the date a bonus is paid. The compensation committee will have the authority to amend, alter, suspend or terminate the Bonus Plan provided such action does not impair the existing rights of any participant with respect to any earned bonus.

- 401(k) and Other Plans: The Company maintains a 401(k) plan for each executive director that is an employee based in the U.S. (i.e. our executive director Mr. Kulkarni). The 401(k) plan is intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the United States Internal Revenue Code, (the 'Internal Revenue Code') so that contributions to the 401(k) plan by employees or by the Company, and the investment earnings thereon, are not taxable to the employees until withdrawn, and so that contributions made by the Company, if any, will be deductible by the Company when made.
- During fiscal 2024, the Company did not offer any retirement benefits to our executive director located in Israel (i.e. our executive director Mr. Banon), except to the extent certain social benefits were required pursuant to Israeli labor laws or are common practice in Israel, and such social benefits were applicable to all Israeli employees. Specifically, based on Israeli labor laws, an employee residing in Israel is entitled to severance pay upon termination of employment for any reason, including retirement, equal to the most recent monthly salary of such employee multiplied by the number of years of employment of such employee.
- Benefits: An executive director may be entitled to allowances and/or benefits in kind. These allowances and benefits may be comprised of elements consistent with market practice (such as, but not limited to contribution to health care costs, fixed annual cost allowances or otherwise) or relate to specific international circumstances (such as, but not limited to, grossed-up costs relating to relocation, accidental and health insurance, housing, school and travel).
- Severance payment: Executive directors may be eligible for a severance payment on termination of office. This severance payment may be included in an employment agreement to provide for compensation for loss of income resulting from non-voluntary termination. Our executive directors' employment agreements also provide that they may be eligible to receive certain severance payments and benefits in connection with certain terminations of employment with the Company, including a termination of employment in connection with a change in control of the Company. A summary of the current terms of the employment agreements entered into with executive directors can be found in the Company's proxy statement filed with the SEC, which is available on the Company's website.

## Scenario Analyses

For the purpose of the Remuneration Policy, non-executive directors have analyzed possible outcomes of the remuneration components and how these affect the remuneration of directors.

## Adjustment to Variable Remuneration

In accordance with Dutch law, the variable remuneration of directors may be:

- i. adjusted to an appropriate level if payment of the variable remuneration were to be unacceptable according to principles of reasonableness and fairness; or
- ii. partly or fully clawed back, to the extent it was paid on the basis of incorrect information (i) underlying the targets to be achieved, or (ii) regarding the circumstances on which the bonus was made conditional.

Additionally, as a public company listed on the NYSE, if we are required to restate our financial results due to our material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirements under the U.S. federal securities laws as a result of misconduct, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer may be legally required to reimburse Elastic for any bonus or other incentive-based or equity-based compensation they receive in accordance with the provisions of section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

Lastly, also in connection with our listing on the NYSE, we have adopted an incentive-based compensation recovery policy with respect to the recovery of erroneously awarded compensation.

## CEO Pay Ratio

Presented below is the ratio of annual total compensation of our median compensated employee to that of Ashutosh Kulkarni, our CEO, in fiscal 2024.

The ratio presented below is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules and applicable guidelines. The SEC's rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee's annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their employee populations and compensation practices. The pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported below, as other companies have different employee populations and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios. As a result, and as explained by the SEC when it adopted these rules, in considering the pay ratio disclosure, shareholders should keep in mind that the rule was not designed to facilitate comparisons of pay ratios among different companies, even companies within the same industry, but rather to allow shareholders to better understand and assess each particular company's compensation practices and pay ratio disclosures.

We identified the median employee using the following methodology:

For each member of the applicable employee population, we used the total of the employee's target cash compensation and equity awards received during fiscal year 2024. For employees paid other than in U.S. dollars, we converted their compensation to U.S. dollars using our anticipated exchange rate for fiscal year 2024. With respect to equity awards, we determined the grant date fair value of restricted stock units awarded during fiscal year 2024 computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 using the closing price of our common stock as reported on the NYSE on the date of grant.

In determining our employee population, we considered the individuals other than our CEO who were employed by us on March 1, 2024, whether employed in a full-time, part-time or temporary capacity. We did not include any contractors, agency workers or other non-employees.

After identifying the median compensated employee, we then calculated the total fiscal year 2024 compensation for this individual using the same methodology we use to calculate the fiscal year 2024 amount reported for our CEO

For fiscal year 2024, the total compensation for our CEO, Mr. Kulkarni, was $12,467,850. The fiscal year 2024 annual total compensation for our median compensated employee was $211,543. Thus, the ratio of our CEO's total fiscal year 2024 compensation to our median compensated employee's total fiscal year 2024 compensation was 59:1.

Neither the Compensation Committee nor our management used this pay ratio in making compensation decisions.

## Remuneration of Non-executive Directors

Each non-executive director is eligible to receive compensation for service on the board of directors and its committees consisting of annual cash retainers and equity awards. Our board of directors has the discretion to revise non-executive director compensation as it deems necessary or appropriate, in accordance with our remuneration policy as previously adopted by an annual general meeting of shareholders (the 'Remuneration Policy').

Cash Compensation . For fiscal year 2024, all non-executive directors were eligible to receive the following cash compensation for their services:

- $35,000 per year for service as a board member;
- $20,000 per year additionally for service as Lead Independent Director;
- $20,000 per year additionally for service as chair of the Audit Committee;
- $10,000 per year additionally for service as an Audit Committee member;
- $15,000 per year additionally for service as chair of the Compensation Committee;
- $7,675 per year additionally for service as a Compensation Committee member;
- $11,000 per year additionally for service as chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee; and
- $5,000 per year additionally for service as a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee member.

All cash payments to non-executive directors, or the retainer cash payments, are paid quarterly in arrears on a pro-rated basis.

Equity Compensation . For fiscal 2024, our non-executive directors were eligible for nondiscretionary, automatic grants of restricted stock units, except for any non-employee director who either (i) beneficially owns more than 2% of the outstanding and issued share capital of the Company, or (ii) is a partner or a member of any venture capital firm that owns securities of the Company representing more than 2% of the outstanding and issued share capital of the Company.

- Initial award . Any eligible non-executive director is granted an initial award of restricted stock units covering a number of shares having a grant date fair value equal to $200,000 pro-rated for the amount of time that remains in the 12-month period prior to the next scheduled annual general meeting of the Company's shareholders (and if the date of such annual general meeting of the Company's shareholders is not known, the one-year anniversary of the most recent Annual Award referred to below granted to non-executive directors), rounded down to the nearest whole share (the 'Initial Award'). The shares underlying the Initial Award will settle on the earlier of (i) the oneyear anniversary of the date the Initial Award is granted or (ii) the day prior to the date of the annual general meeting of our shareholders next following the date the Initial Award is granted, subject to continued service through the applicable vesting date.
- Annual award . For fiscal 2024, on the date of the general meeting of the Company's shareholders, each eligible non-executive director was eligible to be granted an award of restricted stock units covering a number of shares having a grant date fair value equal to $200,000 (the 'Annual

Award'). The shares underlying the Annual Award will settle on the earlier of (i) the one-year anniversary of the date the Annual Award is granted or (ii) the day prior to the date of the annual general meeting of our shareholders next following the date the Annual Award is granted, subject to continued service through the applicable vesting date.

The grant date fair value is computed in accordance with GAAP and is the same under IFRS.

Any award of restricted stock units granted under our non-executive director compensation policy will fully vest and become exercisable in the event of a change in control, as defined in our Amended and Restated 2012 Stock Option Plan (the 'Stock Plan'), provided that the director remains a director through such change in control. Further, our Stock Plan provides that in the event of a merger or such change in control, each outstanding equity award granted under our Stock Plan that is held by a non-executive director will fully vest, all restrictions on the shares subject to such award will lapse, and with respect to awards with performancebased vesting, all performance goals or other vesting criteria will be deemed achieved at 100% of target levels, and all of the shares subject to such award will become fully exercisable, if applicable, provided such director remains a director through such merger or change in control.

Reimbursement of Expenses. The Company reimburses directors for reasonable expenses incurred to attend meetings of the Board and its committees. The Company makes the reimbursement in line with the Company's expense policy after it receives an invoice, including receipts (originals or copies) for the expenses paid.

## Share Ownership Policy

Under the share ownership policy, the CEO, other senior officers designated by the board of directors, and the Company's non-executive directors (collectively 'Covered Persons') are required to own shares with a fair market value at least equal to:

- For the CEO: Five times the CEO's annual base salary
- For senior officers: Two times the senior officer's annual base salary
- For non-executive directors: Three times the non-executive director's annual cash retainer

As of the date of this Report, senior officers subject to the policy included all of our named executive officers and four additional officers of the Company.

The Company expects each Covered Person to (i) own shares with a fair market value at least equal to that specified above within five years after becoming subject to the policy, and (ii) continue to own shares with at least such a fair market value for as long as such person qualifies as a Covered Person under the policy.

For purposes of the policy, owned shares include shares acquired:

- through open market purchases;
- through the Company's employee stock purchase plan; and
- upon exercise of options or settlement of other equity awards held by the Covered Person and issued pursuant to the Company's compensation plans.

## RELATED PARTY DISCLOSURES

For information on related party transactions, see Consolidated Financial Statements - Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 30 Related parties . Where applicable, best practice provisions 2.7.3, 2.7.4 and 2.7.5 of the DCGC, have been observed.

## PROTECTIVE MEASURES

Under Dutch law, protective measures against takeovers are possible and permissible, within the boundaries set by Dutch law and Dutch case law. According to provision 4.2.6 of the DCGC, it is considered best practice to provide a survey of our actual or potential anti-takeover measures, and to indicate in what circumstances it is expected that they may be used. Accordingly, we have set out below a number of provisions in the Articles of Association that may be considered to be anti-takeover measures:

Provisions of our articles of association and resolutions our board of directors have adopted may have the effect of making a takeover of our Company more difficult or less attractive, including as described below:

- Our board of directors has been designated (i) to issue the Company's ordinary shares and grant rights to acquire the Company's ordinary shares in an amount up to 20% of the issued share capital of the Company as of August 21, 2023, and (ii) authorize the board of directors to restrict or exclude pre-emptive rights for issuances of ordinary shares and grants of rights to acquire ordinary shares under the aforementioned share issuance authorization up to a number of shares equal to 10% of the issued share capital of the Company as of August 21, 2023, in each case for a period of 18 months from October 5, 2023. Our board of directors will be seeking shareholder approval to renew this designation for an additional 18 months at the annual General Meeting in 2024.
- Our articles of association include provisions that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control over us or effect a change in our board of directors. These provisions include: a provision that directors can only be appointed upon nomination by our board of directors; a provision that directors may only be removed by a General Meeting by a two-thirds majority of votes cast representing more than half of our outstanding share capital (unless the removal was proposed by the board of directors); a requirement that certain resolutions, including an amendment of our articles of association, may only be adopted by our General Meeting if they are proposed by our board of directors; and a minimum shareholding threshold for shareholders to call shareholders meetings or to add items to the agenda of shareholder meetings.

## Elastic N.V.

## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements April 30, 2024 and 2023

(in thousands U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated)

## 1. Reporting Entity

Elastic N.V. (the 'Company' or 'Elastic') was founded in 2012 and has its corporate seat in Amsterdam, the Netherlands and is registered at the Amsterdam Chamber of Commerce under number 54655870. The address of the Company's registered office is Keizersgracht 281, 1016 ED, Amsterdam.

The consolidated financial statements (the 'Consolidated Financial Statements') of the Company as at April 30, 2024 and 2023 and for the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the 'Group' or 'Elastic' and individually as 'Group entities'). The Group created the Elastic Stack, a powerful set of software products that ingest and store data from any source and in any format, and perform search, analysis, and visualization on that data. Developers build on top of the Elastic Stack to apply the power of search to their data and solve business problems. The Group offers three software solutions built into the Elastic Stack: Search, Observability, and Security. The Elastic Stack and the Group's solutions are designed to run across hybrid clouds, public or private clouds, and multi-cloud environments.

The financial statements were approved by the board and authorized for issue on August 27, 2024.

## Going Concern

The Group generated a net income of $59.2 million and a net loss of $276.1 million for the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The board of directors of the Company (the 'board of directors') has carefully assessed the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. The board of directors has considered the Group's cash flow projections and believes that the Group's cash position will be sufficient to meet operating and capital requirements until at least twelve months from the date of these financial statements, even if the Group does not raise additional financing. Accordingly, the directors are satisfied that the Group will be able to meet its cash requirements through the normal course of operations.

Under International Accounting Standards ('IAS') 1, an entity should prepare financial statements on a going concern basis unless management either intends to liquidate the entity or to cease trading or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Having considered the above, the board of directors determined it was appropriate for these Consolidated Financial Statements to be prepared on a going concern basis. Accordingly, the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared assuming the Group will continue as a going concern. The Consolidated Financial Statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets or to amounts and classification of liabilities that may be necessary if the Group is unable to continue as a going concern.

## 2. Basis of Preparation

## Statement of Compliance

The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union, in conjunction with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. The same accounting principles may be applied in the Company's financial statements (the 'Financial Statements') and Consolidated Financial Statements. If the accounting principles of the Company's Financial Statements differ from the accounting principles applied in the Consolidated Financial Statements, this is disclosed.

## Basis of Measurement

The IFRS financial information has been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for our marketable securities, which have been measured at fair value, and our lease liabilities, which are measured at present value.

## Prior-Period Reclassifications

Certain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current-period presentation.

## Use of Estimates and Judgments

The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with IFRSs requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, standalone selling price ("SSP") for each distinct performance obligation included in customer contracts with multiple performance obligations, the period of benefit for deferred contract acquisition costs, allowance for credit losses, valuation of stock-based compensation, fair value of ordinary shares in periods prior to the

## Elastic N.V.

## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements April 30, 2024 and 2023

(in thousands U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated)

Group's initial public offering, fair value of acquired intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives of acquired intangible assets and property and equipment, whether an arrangement is or contains a lease, and the discount rate used for leases. The Group bases these estimates on historical and anticipated results, trends and various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions as to future events.

Information about assumptions and estimation uncertainties are included in the following notes:

Note 3 and 16 - Share-based payment

Note 3 and 20 - Deferred taxes and utilization of tax losses

Note 3 and 15 - Revenue recognition

Note 3 - Deferred contract acquisition costs

Note 3 and 23 - Business combinations

Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty and therefore require the exercise of judgment. As of the date of issuance of these financial statements, the Group is not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require the Group to update its estimates, judgments or revise the carrying value of the Group's assets or liabilities. These estimates may change, as new events occur and additional information is obtained, and are recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements as soon as they become known. Actual results could differ from those estimates and any such differences may be material to the Group's financial statements.

## Cash Flow Statement

The cash flow statement has been prepared using the indirect method. The cash items disclosed in the cash flow statement are comprised of cash and cash equivalents. Exchange differences affecting cash items are shown separately in the cash flow statement. Interest paid is reflected as an operating activity and interest received as an investment activity.

## Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

The Group has no off-balance sheet arrangements.

## Segments

Operating segments are defined as components of an entity for which separate financial information is available and that is regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker ('CODM'). The Group's Chief Executive Officer is its CODM. The Group's CODM reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for the purposes of making operating decisions, allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. As such, the Group has determined that it operates in one operating and one reportable segment. Financial information about the Group's operating segment and its geographical areas is presented in Note 15 - Revenue to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

## 3. Material Accounting Policies

The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Consolidated Financial Statements. The accounting policies have been applied consistently by Group entities.

## Interpretations and amendments to published standards effective for annual periods beginning on or after May 1, 2023:

The following amendments and interpretations were adopted during the year ended April 30, 2024:

- Amendments to IAS 1 - Disclosure of Accounting Policies
- Amendment to IAS 8 - Definition of Accounting Estimates
- Amendment to IAS 12  - Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction

The amendments to IAS 1, IAS 8 and IAS 12 did not have a material impact on the amounts recognized in prior periods and are not expected to significantly affect the current or future periods.

There are no other IFRSs or International Financials Reporting Interpretations Committee ('IFRIC') interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group.

## Basis of Consolidation

## Subsidiaries

The Consolidated Financial Statements comprise the financial statements of Elastic N.V. and its subsidiaries as at April 30 each year. The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared using consistent accounting policies. Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Company has control. The Company controls an entity when the Company is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.  Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date of the acquisition, being the date on which the Company obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases.

All consolidated companies prepared their accounts during the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023 in accordance with the accounting policies adopted by the Group. The Group has no interest in associates or jointly controlled entities and the Group does not control any special purpose entities that have not been consolidated.

Elasticsearch GmbH, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Elastic N.V., is consolidated in these Consolidated Financial Statements and met all criteria of the exemption contained in article § 264 subsection 3 of German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch, HGB) and therefore does not issue separate audited financial statements.

## Transactions Eliminated on Consolidation

Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealized income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements.

## Foreign Currency

## Functional and Presentation Currency

Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group's entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates ('the functional currency'). The Company periodically re-assesses its operations to determine if previous conclusions are still valid. Changes in functional currencies are applied prospectively if the operations encounter a significant and permanent change. The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in US Dollars (USD), which is the Group's presentation currency.

## Foreign Currency Transactions

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are retranslated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date. The foreign currency gain or loss on monetary items is the difference between amortized cost in the functional currency at the beginning of the period, adjusted for effective interest and payments during the period, and the amortized cost in foreign currency translated at the exchange rate at the end of the reporting period.  Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in the income statement, except when deferred in other comprehensive income (loss) as qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges. Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings and cash and cash equivalents are presented in the income statement within 'finance income' and 'finance costs,' respectively.

Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are retranslated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at the date that the fair value was determined. Foreign currency translation differences arising on retranslation are recognized in profit or loss.  Nonmonetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.

## Translation from Functional to Presentation Currency

For the financial statements of all the Group's entities for which the functional currency is different from the presentation currency of the Group, the following methods are applied:

- The assets and liabilities are translated into USD at the rate effective at the end of the period.
- The revenues and costs are translated into USD at the average exchange rate of the period as long as they represent a reasonable approximation of the exchange rates at the dates of the relevant transactions.

Foreign currency differences on translation from functional to presentation currency are recognized in Translation Reserves.

## Elastic N.V.

## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements April 30, 2024 and 2023

(in thousands U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated)

Foreign exchange gains or losses arising from a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation, the settlement of which is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future and which in substance is considered to form part of the net investment in the foreign operation, are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) in the Translation Reserve.

## Revenue Recognition

The Group generates revenue primarily from the sale of self-managed subscriptions (which include licenses for proprietary features, support, and maintenance) and from the sales of software-as-a-service ("SaaS") subscriptions. The Group also generates revenue from services, which consist of consulting and training.

The Group accounts for revenue in accordance with IFRS 15 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers ('IFRS 15'). Under IFRS 15, the Group recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Group expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Our contracts include varying terms and conditions, and identifying and evaluating the impact of these terms and conditions on revenue recognition requires significant judgment. In determining the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as it fulfills its obligations under each of its agreements, the Group performs the following steps:

## i) identification of the contract with a customer;

The Group contracts with its customers through order forms, which in some cases are governed by master sales agreements. The Group determines that it has a contract with a customer when the order form has been approved, each party's rights regarding the products or services to be transferred can be identified, the payment terms for the services can be identified, the Group has determined the customer has the ability and intent to pay and the contract has commercial substance. The Group applies judgment in determining the customer's ability and intent to pay, which is based on a variety of factors, including the customer's historical payment experience or, in the case of a new customer, credit, reputation and financial or other information pertaining to the customer. At contract inception the Group evaluates whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single contract and whether the combined or single contract includes more than one performance obligation. The Group has concluded that its contracts with customers generally do not contain warranties that give rise to a separate performance obligation.

## ii) identification of the performance obligations in the contract;

Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the products and services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the products or services either on their own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from the Group, and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the products and services is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract.

The Company's self-managed subscriptions include both license providing the right to use proprietary features in its software, as well as an obligation to provide support (on both open source and proprietary features) and maintenance. The Group's SaaS products provide access to hosted software as well as support, which the Group considers to be a single performance obligation.

Services-related performance obligations relate to the provision of consulting and training services. These services are distinct from subscriptions and do not result in significant customization of the software.

- iii) determination of the transaction price;

The transaction price is the total amount of consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for the subscriptions and services in a contract.  Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in our judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur. None of our contracts contain a significant financing component.

## iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and

If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. For contracts that contain multiple performance obligations, the Group allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative standalone selling price ('SSP'). The SSP is determined based on the prices at which the Group separately sells these products, assuming the majority of these fall within a pricing range. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the software license separately, we derive the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable and unobservable inputs which can require significant judgment. There is typically more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by quantity, term of the subscription, sales channel and other circumstances. If one of the performance obligations is outside of the SSP range, the Group allocates the transaction price considering the midpoint of the SSP range. The Group also considers if there are any additional material rights inherent in a contract, and if so, the Group allocates a portion of the transaction price to such rights based on a relative SSP.

## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements April 30, 2024 and 2023

(in thousands U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated)

- v) recognition of revenue when the Group satisfies each performance obligation;

Revenue is recognized at the time the related performance obligation is satisfied by transferring the promised product or service to the customer. Revenue for SaaS offerings that relate to a specified amount of services is recognized on a consumption basis as the customers utilize the services. Revenue from SaaS offerings that are stand-ready arrangements is recognized ratably over the contract period as we satisfy the performance obligation.  The Group's self-managed subscriptions include both upfront revenue recognition when the license is delivered as well as revenue recognized ratably over the contract period for support and maintenance based on the stand-ready nature of these subscription elements.

Services comprise consulting services as well as public and private training. Consulting services are generally time-based arrangements. Revenue from professional services is recognized as these services are delivered.

The Group generates sales directly through its sales team and through its channel partners. Sales to channel partners are made at a discount and revenues are recorded at this discounted price once all the revenue recognition criteria above are met. To the extent that the Group offers rebates, incentives or joint marketing funds to such channel partners, recorded revenues are reduced by this amount. Channel partners generally receive an order from an end-customer prior to placing an order with the Group. Payment from channel partners is not contingent on the partner's collection from end-customers.

## Contract Balances

The timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. For annual contracts, the Group typically invoices customers at the time of entering into the contract. For multi-year agreements, the Group generally invoices customers on an annual basis prior to each anniversary of the contract start date. The Group records unbilled accounts receivable related to revenue recognized in excess of amounts invoiced as the Group has an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment in the future related to those fulfilled obligations. Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue which is recognized over the contractual period.

The following table provides information about unbilled accounts receivable, deferred contract acquisition costs, and deferred income from contracts with customers:

## Deferred Contract Acquisition Costs

Deferred contract acquisition costs represent costs that are incremental to the acquisition of customer contracts, which consist mainly of sales commissions and associated payroll taxes. The Group determines whether costs should be deferred based on sales compensation plans, if the commissions are in fact incremental and would not have occurred absent the customer contract.

Sales commissions for renewal of a subscription contract are not considered commensurate with the commissions paid for contracts with new customers and incremental sales to existing customers given the substantive difference in commission rates in proportion to their respective contract values. Commissions paid for contracts with new customers and incremental sales to existing customers are amortized over an estimated period of benefit of five years while commissions paid for renewal contracts are amortized based on the pattern of the associated revenue recognition over the related contractual renewal period for the pool of renewal contracts. The Group determines the period of benefit for commissions paid for contracts with new customers and incremental sales to existing customers by taking into consideration its initial estimated customer life and the technological life of its software and related significant features. Commissions paid on professional services are typically amortized in accordance with the associated revenue as the commissions paid on new and renewal professional services are commensurate with each other. Amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs is recognized in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss).

The Group periodically reviews the carrying amount of deferred contract acquisition costs to determine whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that could impact the period of benefit of these deferred costs. No impairment of deferred contract acquisition costs was recognized during the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023.

Amortization expense with respect to deferred contract acquisition costs was $78.5 million and $68.9 million for the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

## Financial Instruments

## Non-derivative Financial Assets

The Group has the following non-derivative financial assets: deposits, trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities.

## Receivables

Receivables are financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. Receivables comprise deposits, trade and other receivables, and other current assets (Note 7 - Trade and other receivables) .

After initial recognition at fair value, trade receivables are subsequently measured at amortized cost after provision for bad and doubtful debts. Provisions for bad and doubtful debts are based on the expected credit loss model. The 'simplified approach' is used with the expected loss allowance measured at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses.

## Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents comprise bank account balances and money market funds with original maturities of three months or less. Deposits with financial institutions for a duration greater than three months are excluded from cash and cash equivalents and classified separately in these financial statements. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group's cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.

## Marketable securities

The Company's marketable securities consist of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities. The Company determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation at each balance sheet date. The Company has classified and accounted for its marketable securities as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (loss) as the Company may sell these securities at any time for use in its current operations or for other purposes, including prior to maturity. As a result, the Company has classified its marketable securities within current assets on the consolidated balance sheets.

Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets, where the assets' cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (loss). Movements in the carrying amount are taken through other comprehensive income (loss), except for the recognition of impairment gains or losses, interest income and foreign exchange gains and losses, which are recognized in profit or loss. When the financial asset is unrecognized, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) is reclassified from equity to profit or loss and recognized in other gains (losses). Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method.

## Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The Group follows IFRS 13 - Fair Value Measurement ("IFRS 13"), with respect to assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value. Under this standard, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the reporting date. The accounting guidance establishes a three-tiered hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value as follows:

- Level 1:   Observable inputs, such as unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.
- Level 2:   Observable inputs, other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
- Level 3:   Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities

Financial assets are de-recognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired.

## Non-derivative Financial Liabilities

The Group initially recognizes financial liabilities which include long term borrowings, trade and other accounts payables and other non-current liabilities on the date that they are originated. All other financial liabilities are recognized initially on the trade date at which the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

The financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to the initial recognition, these financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.

## Elastic N.V.

## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements April 30, 2024 and 2023

(in thousands U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated)

The Group de-recognizes a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or canceled or expire.

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the Group has a legal right to offset the amounts and intends either to settle on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

## Share Capital

## Ordinary Shares

The Company's ordinary shares are classified as equity.

Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares or share options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from proceeds.

The Company's ordinary shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange ('NYSE') under the symbol 'ESTC' on October 5, 2018. Prior to that date, there was no public trading market for our ordinary shares.

## Preference Share Capital

Preference share capital is classified as equity if it is nonredeemable, and any dividends are discretionary. Dividends thereon are recognized as distributions within equity upon approval by the Company's shareholders. Preference share capital is classified as a liability if it is redeemable on a specific date or at the option of the shareholders, or if dividend payments are not discretionary. Dividends thereon are recognized as interest expense in profit or loss as accrued. The Company does not have any preference shares outstanding as of April 30, 2024.

## Property and Equipment

## Recognition and Measurement

Items of property and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.

Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for intended use. The assets' residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. The carrying value of an asset is written down to its recoverable amount if the carrying value of the asset is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.

Purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalized as part of that equipment.

Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for intended use.

When parts of an item of property and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property and equipment.

Gains and losses on disposal of an item of property and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property and equipment, and are recognized net within other income in profit or loss.

## Depreciation

Depreciation is calculated over the depreciable amount, which is the cost of an asset, or other amount substituted for cost, less its residual value.

Depreciation is recognized in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property and equipment, since this most closely reflects the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in the asset.

The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative periods are as follows:

- ●
- Leasehold improvements: Remainder of expected use of lease term.
- Computer equipment:

3 years.

- Fixtures and fittings:

3 to 5 years.

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each financial year-end and adjusted if appropriate.

(in thousands U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated)

## Business Combinations

The Group accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method when control is transferred to the Group. The consideration transferred in the acquisition is generally measured at fair value, as are the identifiable net assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. The determination of fair values often requires significant judgements and the use of estimates, including the selection of valuation methodologies, estimates of future revenue and cash flows, discount rates and selection of comparable companies. Acquisition-related costs are expenses as incurred in the operating expenses line of the income statement. Any contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, then it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognized in profit or loss.

When the Group issues stock-based or cash awards to an acquired company's shareholders, the Group evaluates whether the awards are consideration or compensation for post-acquisition services. The evaluation includes, among other things, whether the vesting of the awards is contingent on the continued employment of the acquired company's shareholders beyond the acquisition date. If continued employment is required for vesting, the awards are treated as compensation for post- acquisition services and recognized as expense over the requisite service period.

## Intangible Assets

## Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business combination over the fair value of the Group's share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in 'Intangible assets'. Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. If there are no indicators that goodwill may be impaired then no quantitative analysis is performed. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold. Refer to Note 24- Intangible Assets for more details.

## Trademarks and Customer Related Intangible Assets

Separately acquired trademarks and customer related intangible assets are shown at historical cost. Trademarks and customer-related intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Trademarks, licenses and customer-related intangible assets have a finite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and any accumulated impairment losses. Amortization is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of trademarks, software and customer related intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, as follows:

- Developed technology

4-5 years

- Customer relationships

4 years

- Trade name

4 years

## Internally Developed Software

Internal and external costs incurred during the preliminary stage of developing computer software for internal use are expensed as incurred. Internal and external costs incurred to develop computer software for internal use during the application development stage are capitalized if the Group expects economic benefits from the development. Capitalization in the application development stage begins once the Group can reliably measure the expenditure attributable to the software development and has demonstrated its intention to complete and use the software. Internally developed software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life. The Company did not capitalize any costs during the year ended April 30, 2024 and April 30, 2023.

## Impairment

## Financial Assets (Including Receivables)

The Group applies the IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments ("IFRS 9") simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all receivables.

To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables have been grouped based on the days past the original due date. The expected loss rates are based on the payment profiles of sales over a period of twelve months before April 30, 2024 or 2023, as applicable and the corresponding historical credit losses experienced within this period. The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward-looking information on macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle the receivables.

The following table summarizes the movement in loss allowance on trade and other receivables:

|                                                                          | Year Ended April 30,   | Year Ended April 30,   |

## Borrowings

Borrowings are initially recognized at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently measured at amortized cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption amount is recognized in profit or loss over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issuance of debt are added to or deducted from the initial fair value.

## Employee Benefits

## Defined Contribution Plan

A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts.  Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognized as an employee benefit expense in profit or loss in the periods during which services are rendered by employees.  Prepaid contributions are recognized as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available. Contributions to a defined contribution plan that are due more than 12 months after the end of the period in which the employees render the service are discounted to their present value.

The Group has a defined-contribution plan in the U.S. intended to qualify under Section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code (the '401(k) Plan'). The Group has contracted with a third-party provider to act as a custodian and trustee, and to process and maintain the records of participant data. Substantially all the expenses incurred for administering the 401(k) Plan are paid by the Group. This 401(k) Plan covers substantially all employees who meet minimum age and service requirements and allows participants to defer a portion of their annual compensation on a pre-tax basis The Group makes contributions to the 401(k) Plan up to 6% of the participating employee's W-2 earnings and wages. The Group recorded $18.4 million and $17.9 million of expense related to the 401(k) Plan during the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The Group also has defined-contribution plans in certain other countries for which the Group recorded $12.7 million and $9.4 million of expense during the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The Group's obligation under these plans is recorded in 'Trade and other payables'.

## Defined Benefit Plans

The Group operates no defined benefit plans.

## Termination Benefits

Termination benefits are recognized as an expense when the Group is committed demonstrably, without realistic possibility of withdrawal, to a formal detailed plan to either terminate employment before the normal retirement date, or to provide termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy. Termination benefits for voluntary redundancies are recognized as an expense if the Group has made an offer of voluntary redundancy, it is probable that the offer will be accepted, and the number of acceptances can be estimated reliably. If benefits are payable more than 12 months after the reporting period, then they are discounted to their present value.

## Short-Term Employee Benefits

Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided.

A liability is recognized for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee, and the obligation can be estimated reliably.

## Share-Based Payment Transactions

The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. The benefits given to the employees regarding the grant of the stock awards consists of an additional compensation to these employees estimated at the grant date by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted.

## Elastic N.V.

## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements April 30, 2024 and 2023

(in thousands U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated)

Compensation expense related to stock awards issued to employees, including stock options and restricted stock units ('RSUs') and performance share units ("PSUs") is measured at the fair value on the date of the grant and recognized over the requisite service period. The fair value of stock options and purchase rights issued to employees under the 2022 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("2022 ESPP") is estimated on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of RSUs and PSUs is estimated on the date of the grant based on the fair value of the Company's underlying ordinary shares.

Compensation expense for stock options and RSUs is recognized in the profit or loss over the requisite service period on an accelerated attributed method, with a corresponding adjustment to 'other reserves' for equity settled awards. Compensation expense is recognized over the six-month offering period in the case of the 2022 ESPP. Compensation expense relating to PSUs is recognized using the accelerated attribution method over the requisite service period when it is probable that the performance condition will be satisfied.

Compensation expense for the stock awards are recognized net of forfeitures using an estimated forfeiture rate. Our forfeiture rate is based on an analysis of our actual forfeitures. We will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience, analysis of employee turnover, and other factors. Changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant impact on our share-based compensation expense as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed. A higher or lower revised forfeiture rate than previously estimated will result in an adjustment that will decrease or increase the share-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss).

## Provisions

A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of the discount is recognized as a finance cost.

## Leases

The Group assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease at the inception of the contract. A contract is, or contains a lease, if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Group recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date with respect to all lease arrangements except for short-term leases (leases with a lease term of 12 months or less). For these leases, the lease payments are recognized as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

The right-of-use (ROU) asset is initially measured at cost, comprising the initial amount of the lease liability plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to restore the underlying asset, less any lease incentives received. The ROU asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the asset or the end of the lease term. The Group applies IAS 36 to determine whether an ROU asset is impaired. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the incremental borrowing rate. The lease liability is measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or a rate or a change in the Group's assessment of whether it will exercise an extension or termination option. When the lease liability is remeasured, a corresponding adjustment is made to the ROU asset.

Management uses judgement to determine the lease term where extension and termination options are available within the lease.

Payments associated with short-term leases and all leases of low-value assets are recognized on a straightline basis as an expense in profit or loss. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets comprise IT equipment and small items of office furniture.

The lease liability is initially measured as the present value of the remaining lease payments over the lease term. The discount rate used to determine the present value is the Company's incremental borrowing rate unless the interest rate implicit in the lease is readily determinable. The Company estimates its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at lease commencement date for borrowings with a similar term. The right-of-use asset is initially measured as the present value of the lease payments, adjusted for initial direct costs, prepaid lease payments to lessors and lease incentives.

The Group cannot readily determine the interest rate implicit in the lease contracts for its offices. Therefore, it uses its incremental borrowing rate ('IBR') to measure lease liabilities. The IBR is the rate of interest that the Group would have to pay to borrow over a similar term and with a similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the ROU asset in a similar economic environment. The IBR therefore reflects what the Group 'would have to paid', which requires estimation when no observable rates are available.

## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements April 30, 2024 and 2023

(in thousands U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated)

The weighted-average incremental borrowing rate applied to lease liabilities recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position was 4.92% as of April 30, 2024.

## Finance Income and Finance Costs

Finance income primarily comprises interest income on our cash, cash equivalents and certain marketable securities that is recognized using the effective interest method.

Finance costs primarily consist of interest expense on our 4.125% Senior Notes due 2029 and foreign exchange gains and losses.

## Income Tax

The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognized in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity or other comprehensive income (loss), in which case the tax is also recognized in equity or other comprehensive income (loss), respectively. Current income tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.

Deferred tax is recognized in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognized for the following temporary differences: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future. In addition, deferred tax is not recognized for taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realized simultaneously.

A deferred tax asset is recognized for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences, to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be utilized. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized.

The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgement is required in determining the estimates in relation to the worldwide provision for income taxes. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. The Group recognizes tax provisions when it is considered probable that there will be a future outflow of funds to a tax authority. The provisions are based on management's best judgement of the application of tax legislation and best estimates of future settlement amounts.

The Group has assessed its income tax positions and recorded tax benefits for all years subject to examination, based upon the Group's evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at each period end. The Group assesses uncertainty over a tax treatment in accordance with International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee ('IFRIC') 23. For those tax positions where the Group has determined that it is probable that the taxation authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment, the Group has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit that may potentially be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is determined that it is not probable that the taxation authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment, no tax benefit has been recognized.

Although the Group believes that it has adequately reserved for its uncertain tax positions, the Group can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. As the Group expands internationally, it will face increased complexity, and the Group's unrecognized tax benefits may increase in the future. The Group makes adjustments to its reserves when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the (benefit from) provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.

## Research and Development

Research and development expense primarily consists of personnel costs and allocated overhead costs for employees and contractors.

Research and development costs are charged to operations as incurred. An intangible asset resulting from the development of an individual project is only capitalized when it cumulatively meets the criteria for recognition as per the requirements of IAS 38. Software development costs for software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed are expensed as incurred until the establishment of technological feasibility, at which time those costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers and amortized over the estimated life of the product. Technological feasibility is established upon the completion of a working prototype that has been certified as having no critical bugs and is a release candidate. To date, costs to develop software that is marketed externally have not been capitalized as the current software development process is essentially completed concurrently with the establishment of technological feasibility. As such, all related software development costs are expensed as incurred and included in research and development expense in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss).

## Sales and Marketing

Sales and marketing expense primarily consists of personnel costs, commissions, allocated overhead costs and costs related to marketing programs and user events. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, brand-building and customer acquisition and retention activities.

## General and Administrative

General and administrative expense primarily consists of personnel costs for our management, finance, legal, human resources, and other administrative employees. General and administrative expense also includes professional fees, accounting fees, audit fees, tax services and legal fees, as well as insurance, allocated overhead costs, and other corporate expenses.

## Fiscal Unity Tax Accounting Policy

The Company is head of the fiscal unity for Dutch income tax purposes and is, as such, jointly liable for the liabilities of the fiscal unity as a whole. The Company holds the tax liability and is responsible for the remittance to the tax authorities on behalf of its subsidiary elasticsearch B.V. The tax charge of each individual unity member is calculated and shown in their respective accounts. Settlements within the fiscal unity are made via intercompany accounts. The Company is also head of the fiscal unity for Dutch VAT with Elastic's Dutch subsidiaries (elasticsearch B.V., Elastic International B.V., and Elastic Worldwide B.V.) and is, as such, jointly liable for the VAT liabilities of the fiscal unity as a whole.

## 4. Financial Risk Management

All potential areas of financial risk are regularly monitored and reviewed by the board of directors and management. Any preventative or corrective measures are taken as necessary.

The Group uses various financial instruments. These primarily include cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and trade receivables that arise directly from its operations.

The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:

- Capital Management.
- Market Risk.
- Credit risk.
- Liquidity risk.
- Currency risk.

## Capital Management

The Group's objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group's ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. For the purpose of the Group's capital management, capital includes issued capital, convertible preference shares, share premium and all other equity reserves attributable to the equity holders of the parent.

## Market Risk

The Group is exposed to various kinds of market risks in the ordinary course of business.  These risks include:

- Foreign currency exchange rate risks: Refer to currency risk below.
- Interest rate risks: Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will be affected by changes in the market rate of interest.  The Group had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities of $1.087 billion as of April 30, 2024. The Group's cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash are held in cash deposits and money market funds. The primary objectives of the Group's investment activities are the preservation of capital, the fulfillment of liquidity needs and the fiduciary control of cash and investments. The Group does not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Due to the short-term nature of these instruments, the Group does not believe that an immediate 10% increase or decrease in interest rates would have a material effect on the fair value of its investment portfolio. Declines in interest rates, however, would reduce the Group's future interest income.

In July 2021, Elastic issued $575.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.125% Senior Notes due in 2029 in a private placement. The fair value of the Senior Notes is subject to market risk. In addition, the fair market value of the Senior Notes is exposed to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of the fixed interest rate Senior Notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The interest rate and market value changes affect the fair value of the Senior Notes, but do not impact the Group's financial position, cash flows or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the debt obligation. Additionally, the Senior Notes are carried at face value less unamortized debt issuance cost on the balance sheet.

The Group has developed policies to deal with these risks. In principle, no derivative instruments are used to hedge against either of these risks. The Group seeks to match and manage intercompany and external foreign currency exposures reported by the various business operations and Group Companies.

## Credit Risk

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations and arises principally from the Group's receivables from customers. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Group to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term investments, and accounts receivable. The primary focus of the Group's investment strategy is to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements. The Group maintains its cash accounts with financial institutions where, at times, deposits exceed federal insurance limits. The Group invests its excess cash in highly-rated money market funds and in short-term investments. The Group extends credit to customers in the normal course of business. The Group performs credit analyses and monitors the financial health of its customers to reduce credit risk. Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. Management performs ongoing credit evaluations of customers and maintains allowances for potential credit losses on customers' accounts when deemed necessary.

The Group's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. However, risk associated with the industry and country in which customers operate may also influence credit risk. The credit quality of customers is assessed by taking into account financial position, past experience and other relevant factors. A default on a trade receivable is when the counterparty fails to make contractual payments within the stated payment terms. Trade receivables and contract assets are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. The carrying amounts of financial assets, trade receivables and contract assets represent the maximum credit exposure. Trade receivables and contract assets are subject to impairment using the expected credit loss model. The Group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measure expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected credit loss allowance for all trade receivables and contract assets. To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables and contract assets have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due. See Note 7- Trade and other receivables for further details about trade receivables and contract assets including movement in provision for bad and doubtful debts.

One customer, a channel partner, accounted for 13% and 12% of net accounts receivable as of April 30, 2024 and April 30, 2023, respectively. The same customer accounted for 11% of total revenue during the year ended April 30, 2024. No customer accounted for 10% or more of the Group's total revenue for the year April 30, 2023.

The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at the reporting date by geographic region was as follows:

The Group does not typically offer any right of refund in its contracts. The Group does not consider that any of its clients, business sectors or geographic areas present a significant risk of non-collection that could materially impact the financial position of the Group as a whole.

On that basis, the loss allowance as at April 30, 2024 and 2023 was determined for accounts receivables:

## Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group's reputation.

The Group monitors its cash flow requirements on a regular basis with the board of directors to ensure that within a three-month time frame it has sufficient cash to its expected operational expenses that can be reasonably predicted.

The tables below summarizes the group's financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings for all nonderivative financial liabilities:

|                          | Less than 1 year   | Between 1 & 5 years   | More than 5 years   | Total     | Carrying amount   |

| Senior Notes             | -                  | -                     | 575,000             | 575,000   | 568,612           |
| Lease liabilities        | 12,188             | 12,898                | -                   | 25,086    | 25,086            |
| Total                    | $ 200,615          | $ 21,689              | $ 575,000           | $ 797,304 | $ 790,916         |

## Currency Risk

The Group's revenue and expenses are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. To date, the Group has not had a formal hedging program with respect to foreign currency, but it may do so in the future if its exposure to foreign currency should become more significant. For business conducted outside of the United States, the Group may have both revenue and costs incurred in the local currency of the subsidiary, creating a partial natural hedge. Changes to exchange rates therefore have not had a material impact on the Group's operating

results to date; however, the Group will continue to reassess our foreign exchange exposure as it continues to grow its business globally.

The Group has experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our operating results as a result of transaction gains or losses related to remeasurement of certain asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. An immediate 10% increase or decrease in the relative value of the U.S. dollar to other currencies could have a material effect on the Group's revenue, operating expenses, and net income (loss). As a component of finance income and finance costs, the Group recognized foreign currency transaction losses of $3.4 million and $0.8 million for the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

As of April 30, 2024, the Group's cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities were primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, Euros, and British pounds. A 10% increase or decrease in current exchange rates would have an impact of approximately $10.9 million on the Group's cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash balances and marketable securities.

## Translation Reserve

Translation reserve comprises the translation of participations from a foreign currency to the presentation currency. Exchange differences arising on translation of the foreign controlled entities are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), as described in Note 3, and accumulated in a separate reserve within equity. The cumulative amount is reclassified to profit or loss upon the disposal of the net investment.

## Other Reserves

Other reserves comprise unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities and compensation expense for equity settled awards. There is no distribution restriction on other reserves.

## 12. Borrowings

In July 2021, the Company issued $575.0 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes in a private placement.

Interest on the Senior Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year. The Group received net proceeds from the offering of the Senior Notes of $565.7 million after deducting underwriting commissions of $7.2 million and incurred additional issuance costs of $2.1 million. Total debt issuance costs of $9.3 million are being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes were redeemable, in whole or in part, at any time prior to July 15, 2024 at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus a 'make-whole' premium and accrued and unpaid interest, if any. The Group may at its election redeem all or a part of the Senior Notes on or after July 15, 2024, on any one or more occasions, at the redemption prices set forth in the indenture governing the Senior Notes (the 'Indenture'), plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date. In addition, up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes outstanding under the Indenture was redeemable on any one or more occasions at any time prior to July 15, 2024 with the net cash proceeds of one or more equity offerings at a redemption price equal to 104.125% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes then outstanding, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date. The Group may also at its election redeem the Senior Notes in whole, but not in part, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, if certain changes in tax law occur as set forth in the Indenture.

If the Group experiences a change of control triggering event (as defined in the Indenture), the Group must offer to repurchase the Senior Notes at a repurchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the repurchase date.

The indenture contains covenants limiting the Group's ability and the ability of certain subsidiaries to create liens on certain assets to secure debt; grant a subsidiary guarantee of certain debt without also providing a guarantee of the Senior Notes; and consolidate or merge with or into, or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets to, another person. These covenants are subject to a number of limitations and exceptions. Certain of these covenants will not apply during any period in which the notes are rated investment grade by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and Standard &amp; Poor's Ratings Services.

Based on the trading prices of the Senior Notes, the fair value of the Senior Notes as of April 30, 2024 was approximately $511.8 million.

The net carrying amount of the Senior Notes was as follows (in thousands):

## 2022 Employee Stock Purchase Plan

In August 2022, the Company's board of directors adopted and, in October 2022, the Company's shareholders approved the 2022 ESPP. The Company reserved 6.0 million of the Company's ordinary shares for future purchase and issuance under the 2022 ESPP in January 2023. The 2022 ESPP allows eligible employees to acquire ordinary shares of the Company at a discount at periodic intervals through accumulated payroll deductions. Eligible employees purchase ordinary shares of the Company during a purchase period at 85% of the market value of the Company's ordinary shares at either the beginning or end of an offering period, whichever is lower. Offering periods under the 2022 ESPP are approximately six months long and begin on each of March 16 or September 16 or the next trading day thereafter.

Under the 2022 ESPP, 345,165 ordinary shares were purchased during the year ended April 30, 2024. No ordinary shares were purchased under the 2022 ESPP during the year ended April 30, 2023. Stock-based compensation expense recognized related to the 2022 ESPP was $7.1 million and $0.9 million for the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The fair value of the 2022 ESPP offerings was estimated on the offering date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:

|                                 | Year Ended April 30,   | Year Ended April 30,   |

| Expected stock price volatility | 47.3% - 63.3%          | 64.0%                  |
| Risk-free interest rate         | 5.4% - 5.5%            | 4.9%                   |

## 2012 Share Option Program (Equity-Settled)

In September 2012, the Company's board of directors adopted and the Company's shareholders approved the 2012 Stock Option Plan, which was amended and restated in September 2018 and further amended in December 2021 (as amended and restated, the '2012 Plan'). Under the 2012 Plan, the board of directors, the compensation committee, as administrator of the 2012 Plan, and any other duly authorized committee may grant stock options and other equity-based awards, such as restricted stock awards ('RSAs'), RSUs, and PSUs, to eligible employees, directors, and consultants to attract and retain the best available personnel for positions of substantial responsibility, to provide additional incentive to employees, directors and consultants, and to promote the success of the Group's business.

The Company's board of directors, compensation committee, or other duly authorized committee determines the vesting schedule for all equity-based awards. Stock options and RSUs granted to employees generally vest over four years, subject to the employees' continued service to the Group. During the year ended April 30, 2024, the Company granted PSUs that vest over three years with a one-year performance period. The Company's compensation committee may explicitly deviate from the general vesting schedules in its approval of an equity-based award, as it may deem appropriate. Stock options expire ten years after the date of grant. Stock options, RSAs and RSUs (including PSUs) that are canceled under certain conditions become available for future grant or sale under the 2012 Plan unless the 2012 Plan is terminated.

Information with respect to stock options available and outstanding is as follows:

## Determination of Fair Value

The determination of the fair value of stock-based options on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by the fair value of the Company's ordinary shares, as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of stock options, which requires the use of assumptions including actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, expected price volatility of the Company's ordinary shares, the risk-free interest rate, and expected dividends. Each of these inputs is subjective and generally requires significant judgment to determine.

Fair Value of Ordinary Shares: Subsequent to the Company's initial public offering ('IPO') on October 10, 2018, the fair value of the underlying ordinary shares is determined by the closing price, on the date of the grant, of the Company's ordinary shares, which are traded publicly on the New York Stock Exchange. Prior to the IPO, the fair value of ordinary shares underlying the stock awards had historically been determined by the board of directors, with input from the Company's management. The board of directors previously determined the fair value of the ordinary shares at the time of grant of the awards by considering a number of objective and subjective factors, including valuations of comparable companies, sales of redeemable convertible preference shares, sales of ordinary shares to unrelated third parties, operating and financial performance, the lack of liquidity of the Company's ordinary shares, and general and industry-specific economic outlook.

Expected Term: The expected term represents the period that options are expected to be outstanding.

Expected Volatility: Since the Company has limited trading history of its ordinary shares, the expected volatility is derived from the average historical stock volatilities of several unrelated public companies within the Company's industry that the Company considers to be comparable to its own business over a period equivalent to the option's expected term.

Risk-Free Interest Rate: The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for zero-coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities approximately equal to the option's expected term.

Dividend Rate: The expected dividend is assumed to be zero as the Company has never paid dividends and has no current plans to do so.

The Company's expected volatility and expected term involve management's best estimates, both of which impact the fair value of the option calculated under the Black-Scholes option pricing model and, ultimately, the expense that will be recognized over the life of the option.

## Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)

During the year ended April 30, 2024, the Group granted 3,399,494 RSUs at a weighted-average grant date fair value of $102.23 per unit.

During the year ended April 30, 2024, the Group granted 132,960 PSUs subject to performance and service conditions to certain executives. The PSUs become eligible to vest based on the level of the Group's achievement against a revenue-based performance goal for fiscal 2024. The amount that may be earned ranges from 0% to 200% of the eligible PSUs. Subject to the executives' continued service to the Company through the applicable vesting date, one-third of the eligible PSUs will vest following the end of fiscal 2024 and, thereafter, one-eighth of the remaining eligible PSUs will vest on a quarterly basis over two years. In the event that an executive's continuous service to the Company ceases, any associated unvested PSUs will immediately terminate and be forfeited.

## Impact on the Financial Statements

Compensation cost for employee stock-based awards is based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of IFRS 2 - Share-based Payment ("IFRS 2") and is recognized over the vesting period of the applicable award on an accelerated attribution basis, typically over four to five years. For the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, the Group recorded share-based compensation expense related to issuance of stock options of $4.4 million and $6.1 million, respectively.  As of April 30, 2024, the Company had unrecognized share-based compensation expense of $2.3 million related to unvested stock options that the Company expects to recognize over a weighted average period of 0.85 years.

Share-based compensation expense related to RSUs for the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023 was $237.8 million and $235.2 million, respectively. As of April 30, 2024, the Company had unrecognized sharebased compensation expense of $278.7 million related to equity settled RSUs that the Company expects to recognize over a weighted-average period of 1.46 years.

As of April 30, 2024, the Company has a tax loss carry forward (TLCF) of approximately $1.237 billion (April 30, 2023 - approximately $1.041 billion) related to the Dutch fiscal unity, approximately $1.449 billion (April 30, 2023 - $1.638 billion) related the US (federal and states), and approximately $78.2 million (April 30, 2023 - approximately $74.5 million) related to the United Kingdom.

Trading losses will reverse against future taxable profits in the Company. Certain of these assets have not been recognized due to uncertainties over the timing and nature of such future trading profits in accordance with IAS 12. The majority of the TLCFs are in the US and the Netherlands. TLCFs in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom have not been recognized in the balance sheet. TLCFs have an indefinite life in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, while those in the US have expiry dates starting 2025.

Deferred tax assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Management assesses whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized and therefore recognized in the financial statements. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income. Management makes estimates and judgements about future taxable income based on assumptions that are consistent with the Group's plans and estimates. Based on current management estimates substantially all of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled after more than twelve months.

As of April 30, 2024, based on all available positive and negative evidence, having demonstrated sustained profitability which is objective and verifiable, and taking into account anticipated future profits, the Company has concluded that it is probable the majority of its US federal and certain states' deferred tax assets will be realizable. Accordingly, we recognized $250.7 million of deferred tax assets in Fiscal 2024. Deferred tax assets in California and certain other states has not been recognized due to uncertainties over future taxable profit.

Significant components of the Group's deferred tax assets are summarized as follows (in thousands):

Dutch income taxes and non-Dutch withholding taxes associated with the repatriation of earnings or for temporary differences related to investments in non-Dutch subsidiaries, excluding the U.S subsidiaries, have not been provided for, as the Company intends to reinvest the earnings of such subsidiaries indefinitely or the Company has concluded that no additional tax liability would arise on the distribution of such earnings. Earnings from the Company's U.S. subsidiaries are being treated as being currently repatriated back to the Netherlands though no Dutch income taxes nor U.S. withholding taxes in regard to such repatriations are being recorded due to the Dutch participation exemption provisions and exemption from withholding taxes under the income tax treaty between the Netherlands and the United States.

## 22. Commitments

Our principal commitments primarily consist of our purchase obligations under non-cancelable agreements for cloud hosting, subscription software, and sales and marketing, future non-cancelable minimum payments under leases for our offices, and interest payments due on our Senior Notes. As of April 30, 2024, we had purchase commitments of $424.6 million related to cloud hosting services, future minimum lease payment commitments of $26.7 million, and purchase commitments of $47.8 million related to other contracts.

Subsequent to April 30, 2024, we executed a lease agreement for an office space with an expected commencement date in the third quarter of fiscal 2025. The lease term is approximately 11 years with undiscounted future minimum lease payments of approximately $12.4 million.

In July 2021, we issued $575.0 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes in a private placement. Interest on the Senior Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year.

Our contractual commitment amounts are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and do not include obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty. Purchase orders issued in the ordinary course of business are also excluded, as our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements.

We have also excluded unrecognized tax benefits from the contractual obligations. A variety of factors could affect the timing of payments for the liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits. Therefore, we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of such payments. We believe that these matters will likely not be resolved in

the next 12 months and accordingly we have classified the estimated liability as non-current in the consolidated balance sheet.

Future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable office leases and hosting infrastructure commitments as of April 30, 2024 were as follows:

For cloud hosting commitments, the actual timing may vary depending on services used and total payments under these capacity commitments may be higher than the total minimum depending on services used.

## Other Purchase Commitments

The Group has future purchase obligations related to general corporate services, subscription software and sales and marketing contracts. As of April 30, 2024, the Company had purchase commitments of $47.8 million related to these contracts, primarily due within the next twelve months.

## Letters of Credit

As of April 30, 2024, the Group had $2.3 million in letters of credit outstanding in favor of certain landlords for office space. These letters of credit renew annually and expire on various dates through 2025.

## 23. Business Combinations

## Opster Ltd.

On November 30, 2023, the Company acquired 100% of the share capital of Opster Ltd. ('Opster') for a total purchase consideration of $23.0 million. The purchase consideration includes $3.0 million held back by the Company for indemnity obligations which will be released upon the 18-month anniversary of the acquisition.

The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with IFRS 3 - Business Combinations ("IFRS 3") and, accordingly, the total purchase consideration was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The total purchase price allocated to developed technology and goodwill was $6.0 million and $15.9 million, respectively. The fair value assigned to developed technology was determined using the cost to recreate approach. The developed technology asset is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the useful life of 5 years, which approximates the pattern in which the developed technology is utilized. Goodwill resulted primarily from the expectation of enhancing the efficiency and management of the Elastic Stack and is not deductible for income tax purposes.

The financial results of Opster have been included in the Company's consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) since the acquisition date. Pro forma financial information for this acquisition have not been presented as they were not material.

The Group amortizes intangible assets with a limited useful life using the straight-line method over the following periods:

- ●

- Developed technology

4-5 years

- Customer relationships

4 years

- Trade name 4 years

- Internal Use Software

5 years

Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units (CGUs) (or Groups of CGUs) and evaluated for impairment at the CGU level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment. Other than goodwill there are no intangible assets with indefinite lives.

Goodwill has been generated through the acquisition of various companies. Acquired technologies have been embedded into the Elastic stack and therefore form part of the software that is used by the Group's user base and included within the Group's subscription offerings leading to one revenue stream associated with the sales of Elastic products. The Group, has therefore, determined that it has one CGU.

The recoverable amount of the CGU is based on fair value less costs of disposal. At April 30, 2024, the recoverable amount of the CGU exceeded its carrying value and therefore no impairment was recorded in fiscal 2023. The fair value of the CGU, based on quoted market prices at the end of the reporting period, was $10.186 billion. The quoted market price used for the impairment test held by the Group was the current bid price of $102.22 as of April 30, 2024.

## 25. Earnings per share

## Basic

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit/loss attributable to equity shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding ordinary shares purchased by the company and held as treasury shares.

## Diluted

Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares to take account of all dilutive potential ordinary shares and adjusting the profit/loss attributable, if applicable, to account for any tax consequences that might arise from conversion of those shares.

## 28. Contingencies

## Legal Matters

From time to time, the Group has become involved in claims and other legal matters arising in the ordinary course of business. The Group investigates these claims as they arise. Although claims are inherently unpredictable, the Group does not believe that there were any matters that, if determined adversely to the Group, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations, financial position or cash flows as of April 30, 2024.

The Group accrues estimates for resolution of legal and other contingencies when losses are probable and reasonably estimable.

## Indemnification

The Group enters into indemnification provisions under its agreements with other companies in the ordinary course of business, including business partners, landlords, contractors and parties performing its research and development. Pursuant to these arrangements, the Group agrees to indemnify, hold harmless, and reimburse the indemnified party for certain losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party as a result of the Group's activities. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Group could be required to make under these agreements is not determinable. The Group has never incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements. As a result, the Group believes the fair value of these agreements is not material. The Group maintains commercial general liability insurance and product liability insurance to offset certain of the Group's potential liabilities under these indemnification provisions.

In addition, the Group indemnifies its officers, directors and certain key employees against certain liabilities that may arise as a result of their affiliation with the Group. To date, there have been no claims under any indemnification provisions.

## Gain contingencies

From time to time the Group may realize a gain contingency, although recognition will not occur until cash is received or the gain is deemed as realizable. In connection with a favorable settlement of a legal claim, the Group recognized a gain of $0.4 million and $10.4 million included in other income in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) for the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

## 1. Accounting Information and Policies

## Basis of Preparation

The Company financial statements of Elastic N.V. have been prepared in accordance with the statutory provisions of Part 9, Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. The Company uses the option of Article 362.8 of Part 9, Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code to prepare the Company's Financial Statements, based on the accounting principles of recognition, measurement and determination of profit, as applied in the consolidated financial statements (the 'Consolidated Financial Statements'). These principles also include the classification and presentation of financial instruments, being equity instruments or financial liabilities. The Company presents a condensed income statement, using the facility of Article 402, Book 2, of the Dutch Civil Code. Elastic N.V. 's investments in Group companies are stated using the 'net asset value method' ('netto vermogens waarde methode' ) as further outlined in Note 2.

For the principles of valuation of assets and liabilities and for the determination of results reference is made to the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Based on interpretation of the Dutch Accounting Standard 100.108, the company shall, upon identification of a credit loss on an intercompany loan and/or receivable, eliminate the carrying amount of the intercompany loan and/or receivable for the value of the identified credit loss.

All amounts are presented in thousands USD, unless stated otherwise.

The Company prepared its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards ('IFRS') as adopted by the European Union.

## Financial Fixed Assets

## Investments in Consolidated Subsidiaries

Investments in consolidated subsidiaries are entities (including intermediate subsidiaries and special purpose entities) over which the Company has control, i.e., the power to govern the financial and operating policies, generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. Subsidiaries are recognized from the date on which control is transferred to the Company or its intermediate holding entities and they are de-recognized from the date that control ceases.

The Company applies the acquisition method to account for acquiring subsidiaries, consistent with the approach identified in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of assets transferred, liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquiree, and the equity interests issued by the Company. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Identifiable assets acquired, and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed, in an acquisition are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date and are subsumed into the net asset value of the investment in consolidated subsidiaries. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.

Investments in consolidated subsidiaries are measured at net asset value. Net asset value is based on the measurement of assets, provisions and liabilities and determination of profit based on the principles applied in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

## Investments; Recognition of Losses

When the Company's share of losses in an investment equals or exceeds its interest in the investment (including separately presented goodwill or any other unsecured non-current receivables, being part of the net investment), the Company does not recognize any further losses (unless it has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the investment, in which case the Company will recognize a provision).

## Investments; Unrealized Gains and Losses

Unrealized gains on transactions between the Company and its investments in consolidated subsidiaries are eliminated in full, based on the consolidation principles. Unrealized gains on transactions between the Company and its investments in associates are eliminated to the extent of the Company's stake in these investments.

Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of impairment of the assets transferred.

## 3. Borrowings

In July 2021, the Company issued $575.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.125% Senior Notes due July 15, 2029 in a private placement.

Interest on the Senior Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, commencing on January 15, 2022. The Company received net proceeds from the offering of the Senior Notes of $565.7 million after deducting underwriting commissions of $7.2 million and incurred additional issuance costs of $2.1 million. Total debt issuance costs of $9.3 million are being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes were redeemable, in whole or in part, at any time prior to July 15, 2024 at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus a 'make-whole' premium and accrued and unpaid interest, if any. The Company may at its election redeem all or a part of the Senior Notes on or after July 15, 2024, on any one or more occasions, at the redemption prices set forth in the indenture governing the Senior Notes (the 'Indenture'), plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date. In addition, up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes outstanding under the Indenture was redeemable on any one or more occasions at any time prior to July 15, 2024  with the net cash proceeds of one or more equity offerings at a redemption price equal to 104.125% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes then outstanding, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date. The Company may also at its election redeem the Senior Notes in whole, but not in part, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, if certain changes in tax law occur as set forth in the Indenture.

If the Company experiences a change of control triggering event (as defined in the Indenture), the Company must offer to repurchase the Senior Notes at a repurchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the repurchase date.

The indenture governing the Senior Notes contain covenants limiting the Company's ability and the ability of certain subsidiaries to create liens on certain assets to secure debt; grant a subsidiary guarantee of certain debt without also providing a guarantee of the Senior Notes; and consolidate or merge with or into, or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets to, another person. These covenants are subject to a number of limitations and exceptions. Certain of these covenants will not apply during any period in which the notes are rated investment grade by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and Standard &amp; Poor's Ratings Services.

Based on the trading prices of the Senior Notes, the fair value of the Senior Notes as of April 30, 2024 was approximately $511.8 million.

As of April 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all of its financial covenants under the Indenture associated with the Senior Notes.

| Basis for determining materiality | We used our professional judgement to determine overall materiality. As a basis for our judgement, we used a combination of the loss before income tax and total revenues based on the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) consolidated financial statements as filed on Form 10-K. More specifically, we used benchmarks of 5% of the loss before income tax and 1% of total revenues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Rationale for benchmark applied   | The use of profit/loss before tax and total revenues as primary benchmarks to determine materiality is a generally accepted auditing practice and is based on our analysis of the common information needs of users of the financial statements. The Company uses two accounting frameworks for calculating loss before income tax: • International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union ('EU-IFRS'); and • U.S. GAAP applied for the quarterly and annual earnings releases and the financial statements filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. This framework is the basis for and is applied in the operational accounting records and is predominately used by most of the stakeholders. In our judgment, the users of financial information of the Company are primarily interested in the U.S. GAAP financial information. Any user of these financial statements (EU-IFRS) would likely not review this information in isolation. If users did review this information, it would be in supplement to the U.S. GAAP financial information. Therefore, we applied the 5% and 1%, as per above, on the loss before income tax and the revenue based on U.S. GAAP for the audit of these financial statements.We also tested the appropriateness of the reconciling items from U.S. GAAP to EU-IFRS. |
| Component materiality             | Based on our judgement, we allocate materiality to each component in our audit scope that is less than our overall group materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components was between $3.1 million and $8.8 million.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

We also take misstatements and/or possible misstatements into account that, in our judgement, are material for qualitative reasons.

We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them any misstatement identified during our audit above $790,000 (2022/2023: $800,000) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.

## The scope of our group audit

Elastic N.V. is the parent company of a group of entities. The financial information of this group is included in the consolidated financial statements of Elastic N.V.

We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we, in aggregate, performed sufficient work on the financial statements to enable us to provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the management structure of the Group, the nature of operations of its components, the accounting processes and controls, and the markets in which the components of the Group operate.

In establishing the overall group audit strategy and plan, we determined the type of work required to be performed at component level by the group engagement team and by each component auditor.

| Risk of management override of controls Management is in a unique position to perpetrate fraud because of management's ability to manipulate accounting records and prepare fraudulent financial statements by overriding controls that otherwise appear to be operating effectively. That is why, in all our audits, we pay • attention to the risk of management override of controls in: • the appropriateness of journal entries and other adjustments made in the preparation of the financial statements; • estimates;                                                                           | We evaluated the design and implementation of the internal control system in the processes of generating and processing journal entries and making estimates.We also paid specific attention to the access safeguards in the IT system and the possibility that these lead to violations of segregation of duties. We selected journal entries based on risk criteria and conducted specific audit procedures for these entries. These procedures include, among others, inspection of the entries to source documentation. We also performed specific audit procedures related to important estimates of management as disclosed in Note 2 to the financial statements.We specifically paid attention to the inherent risk of bias of management in estimates. Where we have identified significant transactions outside the normal course of business, we inquired into the nature of the significant transactions and obtained an understanding of the business rationale.We assessed the terms and conditions under which these have been entered into. Our audit procedures did not lead to specific indications of fraud or suspicions of fraud with respect to management override of controls. |

| As part of our risk assessment and based on a presumption that there are risks of fraud in revenue recognition, we evaluated the risk of fraudulent financial reporting from an overstatement of revenues (e.g., through inaccurate revenue recognition). There is a risk for manual manipulation of the input data for the calculation of revenue to be recognised. Revenues is an important key performance indicator to demonstrate performance. In this context, management has been given specific targets for growth in revenue. This could lead to pressure on management to overstate revenue. | We tested, on a sample basis, the delivered performance and transaction prices of the revenue transactions based on sales agreements, delivery documents, sales invoices and cash receipts. In addition, we performed audit procedures by confirming accounts receivable balances or performing cash receipt testing on the accounts receivables balances per year-end to verify existence of sales transaction occurred during the financial year.We also performed procedures over deferred revenue balances, including a re-calculation of the year-end balances. Finally, we performed audit procedures to determine whether credit invoices were registered in the next financial year that indicate incorrectly registered revenue in the current financial year. Our audit procedures did not lead to specific indications of fraud or suspicions of fraud with respect to the revenue reporting                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

We incorporated an element of unpredictability in our audit. During the audit, we remained alert to indications of fraud. Furthermore, we considered the outcome of our other audit procedures and evaluated whether any findings were indicative of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations. Whenever we identify any indications of fraud, we re-evaluate our fraud risk assessment and its impact on our audit procedures.

Our procedures to evaluate the board of directors' going-concern assessment included, amongst others:

- considering whether the board of directors identified events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the entity's ability to continue as a going concern (hereafter: going-concern risks);
- considering whether the board of directors' going-concern assessment includes all relevant information of which we are aware as a result of our audit;
- evaluating the board of directors' current budget and their forecast for at least twelve months from the date of preparation of the financial statements;
- performing inquiries of the board of directors as to its knowledge of going-concern risks beyond the period of the board of directors' assessment.

Our procedures did not result in outcomes contrary to the board of directors' assumptions and judgments used in the application of the going-concern assumption.

## Key audit matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements. We have communicated the key audit matters to the board of directors. The key audit matters are not a comprehensive reflection of all matters identified by our audit and that we discussed. In this section, we described the key audit matters and included a summary of the audit procedures we performed on those matters.

## Key audit matter

Revenue Recognition - Identification and Evaluation of Terms and Conditions in Contracts

As described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, management applies the following steps in their determination of revenue to be recognised:

1. identification of the contract with a customer;
2. identification of the performance obligations in the contract;
3. determination of the transaction price;
4. allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and
5. recognition of revenue when the group satisfies each performance obligation.

The Group's contracts include varying terms and conditions and identifying and evaluating the impact of these terms and conditions on revenue recognition requires significant judgment. For the fiscal year ended 30 April 2024, the Group's revenue was $1,267 million.

The principal consideration for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition, specifically the identification and evaluation of terms and conditions in contracts, is a key audit matter, was the significant judgment by management in identifying and evaluating terms and conditions in contracts that impact revenue recognition. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor's judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating the audit evidence to determine whether terms and conditions in contracts were appropriately identified and evaluated by management.

## Our audit work and observations

We tested the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process, including controls related to the identification and evaluation of terms and conditions in contracts that impact revenue recognition.

Our procedures also included, among others:

1. testing the completeness and accuracy of management's identification and evaluation of the specific terms with customers by examining revenue contracts on a sample basis; and
2. assessing the terms and conditions of the contract including their impact on revenue recognition.

Based on our procedures we did not identify material exceptions.

We also evaluated management's disclosures of significant judgments in relation to the Group's revenue recognition (note 3). Based on our procedures we considered the disclosures made in these notes to be adequate.

## Report on the other information included in the annual accounts

The annual accounts contains other information. This includes all information in the annual accounts in addition to the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon.

Based on the procedures performed as set out below, we conclude that the other information:

- is consistent with the financial statements and does not contain material misstatements; and
- contains all the information regarding the Dutch Statutory Board report and the other information that is required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.

We have read the other information. Based on our knowledge and the understanding obtained in our audit of the financial statements or otherwise, we have considered whether the other information contains material misstatements.

By performing our procedures, we comply with the requirements of Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and the Dutch Standard 720. The scope of such procedures was substantially less than the scope of those procedures performed in our audit of the financial statements.

The board of directors is responsible for the preparation of the other information, including the Dutch Statutory Board report and the other information in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code

## Report on other legal and regulatory requirements

## Our appointment

We were appointed as auditors of Elastic N.V. following the passing of a resolution by the shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders held on 28 September 2018. Our appointment as auditors of Elastic N.V and its predecessor Elasticsearch Global B.V. has been renewed annually by shareholders representing a total period of uninterrupted appointment of twelve years .

## Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit

## Responsibilities of the board of directors

The board of directors is responsible for:

- the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with EU-IFRS and Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code; and for
- such internal control as the board of directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

As part of the preparation of the financial statements, the board of directors is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Based on the financial reporting frameworks mentioned, the board of directors should prepare the financial statements using the going-concern basis of accounting unless the board of directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The board of directors should disclose in the financial statements any event and circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.

The Audit Committee of the board of directors is responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process.

## Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our responsibility is to plan and perform an audit engagement in a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence to provide a basis for our opinion. Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high but not absolute level of assurance, and is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Dutch Standards on Auditing will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.

Materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and the evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on our opinion.

A more detailed description of our responsibilities is set out in the appendix to our report.

## Appendix to our auditor's report on the financial statements 2023/2024 of Elastic N.V.

In addition to what is included in our auditor's report, we have further set out in this appendix our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements and explained what an audit involves.

## The auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

We have exercised professional judgement and have maintained professional scepticism throughout the audit in accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing, ethical requirements and independence requirements. Our audit consisted, among other things, of the following:

- Identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designing and performing audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the intentional override of internal control.
- Obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control.
- Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the board of directors.
- Concluding on the appropriateness of the board of directors' use of the going-concern basis of accounting, and based on the audit evidence obtained, concluding whether a material uncertainty exists related to events and/or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report and are made in the context of our opinion on the financial statements as a whole. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
- Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and evaluating whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

Considering our ultimate responsibility for the opinion on the consolidated financial statements, we are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. In this context, we have determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures for components of the Group to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole. Determining factors are the geographic structure of the Group, the significance and/or risk profile of group entities or activities, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates. On this basis, we selected group entities for which an audit or review of financial information or specific balances was considered necessary.

We communicate with the Audit Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We provide the Audit Committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.

From the matters communicated with the Audit Committee, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
